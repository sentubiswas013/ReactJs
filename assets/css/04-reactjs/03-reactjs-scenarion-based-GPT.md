### **ReactJS – Practical / Situation-Based / Real-World Questions**

1. Your component fetches data from an API and re-renders multiple times unnecessarily. How do you optimize it?

2. You have a parent component with multiple children. Updating parent state causes all children to re-render. How do you prevent it?

3. How would you manage a **multi-step form** where users can navigate back and forth without losing data?

4. A child component deep in the component tree needs to update global state. How do you achieve this without prop drilling?

5. How do you implement conditional rendering for loading, error, and success states in a component?

6. Your app displays a **large list of items**, and performance drops when interacting with other components. How do you optimize rendering?

7. You have a component that subscribes to a WebSocket for live updates. How do you handle cleanup when the component unmounts?

8. You need to fetch data from **multiple APIs simultaneously** and display it once all are ready. How do you manage this in React?

9. How would you implement authentication in React where the token persists across refreshes and user data is accessible globally?

10. Your app has shared state, some frequently updated, some rarely. How do you decide between **Context API, Redux, or local state**?

11. How do you implement **lazy loading** for large components to improve initial load time?

12. How do you manage a complex form with **dependent fields** and validation rules in React?

13. A component may throw errors during rendering. How do you prevent it from crashing the whole app?

14. How do you decide which values should be **props** vs **local state** in a component?

15. How would you integrate a **third-party library** that manipulates the DOM into a React component safely?

16. How do you handle **debouncing or throttling** input changes (e.g., search box) to avoid unnecessary re-renders or API calls?

17. How would you **share state** across multiple unrelated components without prop drilling?

18. Your component fetches data every few seconds (polling). How do you ensure it doesn’t cause memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders?

19. How do you optimize performance for **re-rendering charts or data-heavy visualizations** in React?

20. How do you handle **error handling and fallback UI** for API failures in a React application?
