## Java Design Patterns

### 562. **When will you use Strategy Design Pattern in Java?**

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is used when you want to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime based on the context. This pattern is useful when:

- **You have multiple ways to perform a task**, and you want to select the appropriate one dynamically.
- **You need to change the behavior of a class without modifying it** by changing the strategy object.
- **You want to avoid large conditionals or switch statements** that handle different behaviors based on different conditions.
  
#### Example Use Case:
- **Sorting algorithms**: If you have multiple sorting algorithms (like QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort) and you want to dynamically choose one at runtime based on some context, the Strategy pattern is ideal.
- **Payment processing**: If you have different payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer), and you want to select the payment method dynamically, you can use the Strategy pattern.

#### Example:
```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;
    
    public PaymentContext(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }
    
    public void executePayment(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

public class StrategyPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentContext context = new PaymentContext(new CreditCardPayment());
        context.executePayment(100);  // Output: Paid 100 using Credit Card.
        
        context = new PaymentContext(new PayPalPayment());
        context.executePayment(200);  // Output: Paid 200 using PayPal.
    }
}
```

### 563. **What is Observer Design Pattern?**

The **Observer Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern in which an object (called the **subject**) maintains a list of its dependents (called **observers**) and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. This pattern is commonly used for implementing distributed event-handling systems, in which one object (the subject) changes state and all its dependents (the observers) are notified and updated automatically.

#### Key Points:
- **One-to-many dependency**: A subject can have multiple observers.
- **Loose coupling**: Observers are decoupled from the subject. The subject does not need to know the specifics of the observers.
- **Real-time updates**: When the subject changes its state, the observers are immediately updated.

#### Example Use Cases:
- **GUI frameworks**: In GUI applications, buttons or other components may act as subjects, and listeners (observers) may respond to user actions.
- **Event handling systems**: Notification systems, where multiple receivers observe changes in a sender's state.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Subject (Observable)
interface Subject {
    void addObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

class NewsAgency implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String news;

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(news);
        }
    }

    public void setNews(String news) {
        this.news = news;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

// Observer
interface Observer {
    void update(String news);
}

class NewsChannel implements Observer {
    private String channelName;
    
    public NewsChannel(String channelName) {
        this.channelName = channelName;
    }

    public void update(String news) {
        System.out.println(channelName + " received news: " + news);
    }
}

public class ObserverPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NewsAgency newsAgency = new NewsAgency();
        
        NewsChannel bbc = new NewsChannel("BBC");
        NewsChannel cnn = new NewsChannel("CNN");
        
        newsAgency.addObserver(bbc);
        newsAgency.addObserver(cnn);
        
        newsAgency.setNews("Breaking News: Observer pattern explained!");
        // Output:
        // BBC received news: Breaking News: Observer pattern explained!
        // CNN received news: Breaking News: Observer pattern explained!
    }
}
```

### 564. **What are the examples of Observer Design Pattern in JDK?**

Examples of the **Observer Design Pattern** in the JDK:

1. **`java.util.Observer` and `java.util.Observable`**:
   - These are the traditional classes in the JDK where the `Observer` interface represents the observer, and `Observable` is the subject. When the state of the observable changes, the observers are notified.
   
   ```java
   import java.util.Observable;
   import java.util.Observer;
   
   class NewsAgency extends Observable {
       private String news;
       
       public void setNews(String news) {
           this.news = news;
           setChanged();
           notifyObservers();
       }
       
       public String getNews() {
           return news;
       }
   }
   
   class NewsChannel implements Observer {
       private String name;
       
       public NewsChannel(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
       
       @Override
       public void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
           NewsAgency agency = (NewsAgency) o;
           System.out.println(name + " received news: " + agency.getNews());
       }
   }
   
   public class ObserverPatternExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           NewsAgency agency = new NewsAgency();
           NewsChannel bbc = new NewsChannel("BBC");
           NewsChannel cnn = new NewsChannel("CNN");
           agency.addObserver(bbc);
           agency.addObserver(cnn);
           agency.setNews("New Article Published!");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Event Listeners**:
   - Java's event handling mechanism, where events (like `ActionEvent`, `MouseEvent`, etc.) are the subject, and event listeners are the observers. For example, `ActionListener` in Swing listens to button clicks.

### 565. **How Strategy Design Pattern is Different from State Design Pattern in Java?**

Both the **Strategy** and **State** design patterns deal with the behavior of an object, but they are used in different contexts:

- **Strategy Pattern**:
  - **Purpose**: It is used to allow the selection of an algorithm at runtime. The behavior can be changed by swapping the strategy object.
  - **Context**: You use the Strategy pattern when you have multiple ways of performing a task and you want to choose between them dynamically, without changing the context or class performing the operation.
  - **Example**: Payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, etc.) selected at runtime.

- **State Pattern**:
  - **Purpose**: It is used to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object appears to change its class when its state changes.
  - **Context**: The State pattern is used when an object’s behavior is dependent on its internal state, and it needs to change its behavior when the state changes (like a state machine).
  - **Example**: A context-dependent workflow, such as a document editor, where the document’s state could be "draft," "review," or "published."

#### Key Difference:
- **Strategy**: Used to change an algorithm's behavior dynamically.
- **State**: Used to change the behavior of an object based on its internal state.

### 566. **Can you explain Decorator Design Pattern with an Example in Java?**

The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a structural pattern that allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object without affecting other objects of the same class. It is used to extend functionality without modifying the object.

#### Key Points:
- **Composition over inheritance**: It uses composition to add behavior instead of subclassing.
- **Dynamic Behavior Addition**: You can add functionality at runtime.

#### Example:
```java
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
    double cost();
}

// Concrete Component
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public double cost() {
        return 5;
    }
}

// Decorator class (abstract)
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;
    
    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = coffee;
    }
    
    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost();
    }
}

// Concrete Decorator
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }
    
    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost() + 2;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }
    
    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost() + 1;
    }
}

public class DecoratorPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println("Cost of Simple Coffee: " + coffee.cost());  // Output: 5
        
        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println("Cost of Coffee with Milk: " + coffee.cost());  // Output: 7
        
        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println("Cost of Coffee with Milk and Sugar: " + coffee.cost());  // Output: 8
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `SimpleCoffee` is the base object.
- `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` are decorators that add behavior (cost in this case) to the `SimpleCoffee` object.
- Decorators can be stacked to add multiple features



### 567. **What is a good scenario for using Composite Design Pattern in Java?**

The **Composite Design Pattern** is used when you need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in a uniform way. It is particularly useful for **hierarchical structures** where you have objects that can be part of a tree-like structure, and each node can either be a simple object or a composite of other objects.

#### Good Scenarios for Using Composite Design Pattern:
- **File System Representation**: If you're building a file system application where files and directories can be represented as objects. A directory may contain multiple files or other directories. You can treat both files and directories in a uniform way.
  
- **UI Components**: If you're designing a UI framework, where individual UI elements (like buttons, labels, etc.) can be grouped together to form composite elements like panels or windows, you can use the Composite pattern to treat both individual and composite elements uniformly.

- **Organization Hierarchies**: When building systems to represent organizational structures, such as companies, where each employee is either an individual (leaf) or a manager (composite), and you need to treat both employees and teams uniformly.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component
interface Component {
    void display();
}

// Leaf
class File implements Component {
    private String name;
    
    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}

// Composite
class Directory implements Component {
    private String name;
    private List<Component> components = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void addComponent(Component component) {
        components.add(component);
    }
    
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (Component component : components) {
            component.display();
        }
    }
}

public class CompositePatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file1 = new File("file1.txt");
        File file2 = new File("file2.txt");
        
        Directory directory = new Directory("Documents");
        directory.addComponent(file1);
        directory.addComponent(file2);
        
        directory.display();
    }
}
```
Output:
```
Directory: Documents
File: file1.txt
File: file2.txt
```

### 568. **Have you used Singleton Design Pattern in your Java Project?**

The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a single instance of a class should exist throughout the application.

#### Common Use Cases for Singleton:
- **Logging**: A logger should be instantiated only once and used globally across the application.
- **Configuration Management**: Configuration settings are often shared across various parts of an application, so a single instance is used for all configuration settings.
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling or a single database connection should be used throughout the lifecycle of an application.

### 569. **What are the main uses of Singleton Design Pattern in Java Projects?**

The **Singleton Design Pattern** is widely used in Java projects for the following reasons:

1. **Global Access Point**: It ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it. This is useful for shared resources.
  
2. **Resource Management**: It is used in cases where creating multiple instances of a class would be resource-intensive or unnecessary, such as managing a connection pool, logging, or caching.

3. **Ensuring Consistency**: The Singleton pattern guarantees that all parts of the program that require access to the class use the same instance, ensuring consistency.

4. **Thread Pooling**: In scenarios like thread pools, only one instance of a thread pool manager should be used to efficiently handle tasks across the application.

5. **Configuration Classes**: A Singleton can be used to store and access configuration settings, where you need a single, consistent source of configuration throughout your application.

### 570. **Why `java.lang.Runtime` is a Singleton in Java?**

`java.lang.Runtime` is a **Singleton** because:
- **Single System Instance**: The `Runtime` class provides access to the Java runtime environment. There is only one instance of the runtime environment per Java application, making the `Runtime` class a natural fit for the Singleton pattern.
  
- **Resource Management**: `Runtime` is responsible for managing resources like memory and processes. Having multiple instances of the `Runtime` class could lead to inconsistencies and problems in managing these resources. Thus, it is implemented as a Singleton to maintain consistent access to the environment’s resources.

- **Global Access**: The `Runtime` class provides methods like `getRuntime()` to get the instance, which ensures that only one instance is accessible globally throughout the program.

### 571. **What is the way to implement a thread-safe Singleton Design Pattern in Java?**

To implement a **thread-safe Singleton** pattern in Java, there are a few approaches. The most commonly used ones are:

1. **Lazy Initialization with Synchronization**:
   - **Double-Checked Locking**: This approach uses `synchronized` blocks and double checks to ensure thread safety while minimizing the performance overhead.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The first `if` check prevents unnecessary synchronization once the instance is created.
  - The `synchronized` block ensures that only one thread can create the instance at a time.
  - `volatile` ensures that the instance is correctly visible to all threads.

2. **Eager Initialization**:
   - This method initializes the Singleton instance when the class is loaded, ensuring thread safety without synchronization.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The instance is created at the time of class loading, ensuring that it is thread-safe without the need for synchronization.
  - This approach does not support lazy initialization but is simpler and ensures thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

3. **Bill Pugh Singleton Design** (Recommended):
   - This uses the **Static Inner Class** approach, which is thread-safe and efficient.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() { }

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The instance is created when the `SingletonHelper` class is accessed for the first time, making it thread-safe.
  - This is a highly efficient and lazy-loaded implementation.
  - The `SingletonHelper` class is not loaded until the `getInstance()` method is called, which ensures thread safety and avoids synchronization issues.

### 572. **What are the examples of Singleton Design Pattern in JDK?**

Some examples of the **Singleton Design Pattern** in the JDK include:

1. **`java.lang.Runtime`**: The `Runtime` class provides methods for interacting with the Java runtime environment, such as memory management, garbage collection, etc. There is only one instance of `Runtime`, which is globally accessible via the `getRuntime()` method.

   Example:
   ```java
   Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
   ```

2. **`java.lang.System`**: The `System` class is another example, providing utility methods related to the environment and runtime, like `System.out` for printing to the console. It is a singleton that gives access to system properties and environment variables.

   Example:
   ```java
   System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   ```

3. **`java.awt.Desktop`**: The `Desktop` class provides methods to launch the default web browser, open files, etc. The class is a singleton, and you access its single instance via `Desktop.getDesktop()`.

   Example:
   ```java
   Desktop desktop = Desktop.getDesktop();
   ```

4. **`javax.management.MBeanServer`**: The MBeanServer is used to manage and monitor MBeans in a Java application. It follows the Singleton pattern and ensures a single instance is used throughout the application.

5. **`java.util.logging.Logger`**: The `Logger` class is used for logging messages in Java. It provides a singleton instance that is accessed through `Logger.getLogger()`. 

   Example:
   ```java
   Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
   ```

These classes are examples of the Singleton pattern because they provide a single instance that can be accessed globally across the application.

### 573. **What is Template Method Design Pattern in Java?**

The **Template Method Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in the superclass, allowing subclasses to implement specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

- The template method defines the steps of an algorithm and calls the specific methods (some of which may be abstract) that can be implemented by the subclasses.
- This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm but ensures the overall structure remains unchanged.

#### Key Features:
- **Template Method**: The method in the superclass defines the algorithm skeleton.
- **Abstract Methods**: These are methods that the subclasses must implement to complete the steps of the algorithm.
- **Hooks**: These are optional methods that can be overridden by subclasses, providing additional flexibility.

#### Example:

```java
abstract class AbstractClass {
    // Template Method
    public final void performTask() {
        step1();
        step2();
        step3();
    }

    // Concrete methods
    private void step1() {
        System.out.println("Step 1: Do something common.");
    }

    private void step2() {
        System.out.println("Step 2: Do something common.");
    }

    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void step3();
}

class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass {
    @Override
    protected void step3() {
        System.out.println("Step 3: Do something specific to ConcreteClass.");
    }
}

public class TemplateMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractClass obj = new ConcreteClass();
        obj.performTask();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Step 1: Do something common.
Step 2: Do something common.
Step 3: Do something specific to ConcreteClass.
```

The `performTask` method is the template method that defines the overall structure of the algorithm. Subclasses can provide their own specific implementation of the `step3` method.

---

### 574. **What are the examples of Template Method Design Pattern in JDK?**

Here are a few examples of the **Template Method Design Pattern** used in the JDK:

1. **`java.util.AbstractList`**: This abstract class implements the **Template Method** pattern. It provides the skeleton for methods like `add()`, `remove()`, and `get()`, while allowing subclasses to define specific implementations for some of these operations.

2. **`java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream`**: The `InputStream` and `OutputStream` classes define methods like `read()` and `write()`. Some subclasses like `FileInputStream`, `BufferedInputStream`, and `DataInputStream` provide the specific implementation of these methods, but the basic structure remains the same.

3. **`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`**: The `HttpServlet` class defines the `doGet()`, `doPost()`, etc., methods, which serve as a template for HTTP-based request handling. The concrete servlet classes (like `HttpServlet`) provide specific implementations for these methods, but the basic structure of processing requests is predefined in the `HttpServlet`.

---

### 575. **Can you tell some examples of Factory Method Design Pattern implementation in Java?**

The **Factory Method Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is used to promote loose coupling and allows the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

#### Examples of Factory Method Pattern in JDK:

1. **`java.util.Calendar`**: The `Calendar` class uses the Factory Method pattern through its `getInstance()` method to create various types of `Calendar` objects based on locale and time zone.
   ```java
   Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
   ```

2. **`java.text.NumberFormat`**: The `NumberFormat` class uses a Factory Method `getInstance()` to create number formatters based on the current locale.
   ```java
   NumberFormat format = NumberFormat.getInstance();
   ```

3. **`java.util.List`**: The `List` interface provides a static factory method `List.of()` to create an immutable list.
   ```java
   List<String> list = List.of("apple", "banana", "cherry");
   ```

4. **`javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory`**: The `DocumentBuilderFactory` class uses a factory method `newInstance()` to create an instance of `DocumentBuilder`, which can be used to parse XML documents.
   ```java
   DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
   DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
   ```

---

### 576. **What is the benefit we get by using Static Factory Method to create objects?**

Using a **Static Factory Method** to create objects provides several benefits:

1. **Control over Object Creation**: The factory method allows more control over the creation process, such as deciding when and how objects should be created.

2. **Better Encapsulation**: It hides the instantiation logic from the client, making the object creation process more flexible and encapsulated.

3. **Alternative to Constructors**: Static factory methods can be used in place of constructors. They can return objects of subclasses, handle caching, or return `null` for invalid conditions, unlike constructors that always return an instance.

4. **Naming**: You can provide meaningful names to the factory methods, which makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose of the method compared to using generic constructor names.

   Example:
   ```java
   public class Product {
       private Product() {
           // private constructor
       }

       public static Product createProduct() {
           return new Product();
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Singleton Support**: Static factory methods are often used to implement **Singletons**, as they allow the method to return a single instance of a class.
   
6. **Flexibility**: They can return different subclasses depending on input parameters or configuration, providing more flexibility than constructors.

7. **Immutability**: Static factory methods are commonly used with immutable objects, where the constructor may be private, and the factory method ensures proper initialization.

### 577. **What are the examples of Builder Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. In this pattern, a builder class is responsible for the construction of the object. The pattern allows for more control over the construction process and separates the construction logic from the object representation.

Examples of **Builder Design Pattern** in JDK:

1. **`StringBuilder`**: 
   - The `StringBuilder` class is an implementation of the Builder pattern. It allows appending characters and strings step by step to form a string. Instead of concatenating strings (which is inefficient), `StringBuilder` is used to construct strings in a more optimized way.
   ```java
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
   sb.append("Hello").append(" ").append("World");
   String result = sb.toString();
   ```

2. **`java.lang.StringBuilder` (Fluent API) and `java.lang.StringBuffer`**: 
   - Both classes follow the Builder pattern by providing methods to modify an existing string without creating new instances. These classes allow method chaining.

3. **`java.time.LocalDateTime`**: 
   - The `LocalDateTime` class uses the builder pattern in methods such as `of()`, `now()`, and `withYear()` that provide flexible ways of constructing `LocalDateTime` instances step by step.
   ```java
   LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2024, 12, 19, 10, 30);
   ```

4. **`java.lang.ProcessBuilder`**: 
   - `ProcessBuilder` is used to create and configure operating system processes. You can build a process using its methods and set environment variables, command arguments, and working directories.
   ```java
   ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder("echo", "Hello, World");
   Process process = builder.start();
   ```

---

### 578. **What are the examples of Abstract Factory Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Examples of **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** in JDK:

1. **`javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory`**:
   - `DocumentBuilderFactory` is an abstract factory used to create `DocumentBuilder` objects. It provides a way to generate XML parsers based on the underlying configuration and platform.
   ```java
   DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
   DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
   ```

2. **`java.util.Calendar`**:
   - The `Calendar` class is an abstract factory pattern used for creating instances of various types of `Calendar` objects, depending on the locale and time zone.
   ```java
   Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
   ```

3. **`javax.swing.UIManager`**:
   - `UIManager` is an abstract factory that provides a way to create different look-and-feel elements, depending on the platform's native UI.
   ```java
   UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
   ```

### 579. **What are the examples of Decorator Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a structural pattern that allows you to add behavior to an object dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class. It is achieved by wrapping the object in a decorator class.

Examples of **Decorator Design Pattern** in JDK:

1. **`java.io.BufferedReader`**:
   - `BufferedReader` is a decorator for `Reader` objects. It provides additional functionality such as buffering, which improves efficiency when reading data.
   ```java
   BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
   ```

2. **`java.io.BufferedOutputStream`**:
   - `BufferedOutputStream` decorates an `OutputStream` to add buffering capabilities. This improves performance by reducing the number of I/O operations.
   ```java
   BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("output.txt"));
   ```

3. **`java.util.Collections`**:
   - The `Collections` class provides several utility methods that decorate existing collections. For example, `Collections.synchronizedList()` wraps a `List` to make it thread-safe, or `Collections.unmodifiableList()` creates a read-only view of a list.
   ```java
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   List<String> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(list);
   ```

4. **`javax.swing.JScrollPane`**:
   - The `JScrollPane` class is a decorator for adding scrolling capabilities to other components (e.g., `JTextArea`, `JPanel`), providing additional functionality without modifying the original components.

---

### 580. **What are the examples of Proxy Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Proxy Design Pattern** is a structural pattern where a surrogate or placeholder object controls access to another object. It provides a mechanism to access an object indirectly, usually for purposes like lazy loading, access control, logging, or caching.

Examples of **Proxy Design Pattern** in JDK:

1. **`java.lang.reflect.Proxy`**:
   - The `Proxy` class in the `java.lang.reflect` package provides a mechanism to create proxy instances for interfaces. These proxies are used to create dynamic proxy classes for interfaces, which can be used to implement behaviors such as logging or security checks.
   ```java
   MyInterface proxyInstance = (MyInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
       MyInterface.class.getClassLoader(),
       new Class[] { MyInterface.class },
       new MyInvocationHandler());
   ```

2. **`java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject`**:
   - In Remote Method Invocation (RMI), the `UnicastRemoteObject` class is a proxy that enables the server-side object to act as a stub to communicate with a remote client.

3. **`javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper`**:
   - The `HttpServletRequestWrapper` class is a proxy that allows you to modify the behavior of an HTTP request. You can subclass it to override methods and add additional behavior, like logging or validation, while maintaining the same underlying request.

---

### 581. **What are the examples of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

Examples of **Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern** in JDK:

1. **`java.util.logging.Handler`**:
   - The `Handler` class in the `java.util.logging` package is a classic example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern. It is used to send log messages to different destinations (console, file, etc.). Handlers are linked in a chain where each handler can process or pass the log request to the next handler in the chain.
   ```java
   Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());
   ConsoleHandler consoleHandler = new ConsoleHandler();
   FileHandler fileHandler = new FileHandler("log.txt");
   logger.addHandler(consoleHandler);
   logger.addHandler(fileHandler);
   ```

2. **`javax.servlet.Filter`**:
   - The `Filter` interface in servlets can be used to create a chain of filters. Filters can process requests and responses and modify them or pass them along to the next filter in the chain.
   ```java
   FilterChain chain = request -> { /* filter logic */};
   ```

3. **`javax.mail.Transport`**:
   - The `Transport` class in JavaMail API uses the Chain of Responsibility pattern to manage email sending. Different types of transport protocols (SMTP, POP3) are handled by different parts of the chain. 


### 582. **What are the main uses of Command Design Pattern?**

The **Command Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object. This allows users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides the ability to undo operations, queue requests, and support logging and transactions. The key idea behind the pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, which allows for more flexibility in handling and executing the requests.

**Main uses of the Command Design Pattern**:
1. **Undo/Redo functionality**: Allows the user to undo or redo an action. By storing previous actions in a stack, the command pattern can facilitate undo and redo operations.
2. **Decoupling the sender and receiver**: The sender does not need to know about the implementation details of the request; it just knows the command to execute.
3. **Queueing operations**: You can queue a series of commands to be executed later. This is helpful in scheduling tasks or executing them asynchronously.
4. **Logging operations**: Commands can be logged and stored for future use, useful for debugging or auditing.
5. **Macro Commands**: A single command object can represent a series of commands. This is useful in creating macro commands where multiple actions are grouped together as one.

### 583. **What are the examples of Command Design Pattern in JDK?**

**Examples of Command Design Pattern in JDK**:

1. **`java.awt.event.ActionListener`**:
   - The `ActionListener` interface is a typical example of the Command pattern. The `actionPerformed` method acts as the command that is executed when an action is performed on a component, such as a button click.
   ```java
   Button button = new Button("Click Me");
   button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           System.out.println("Button clicked!");
       }
   });
   ```

2. **`java.lang.Runtime.exec()`**:
   - The `exec()` method of the `Runtime` class allows commands to be executed in a separate process. The execution of commands is abstracted by the `exec` method, allowing flexible management of commands and their arguments.
   ```java
   try {
       Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ls");
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   ```

3. **Swing/JavaFX Buttons**:
   - In GUI programming, Swing and JavaFX make extensive use of the Command pattern by associating actions like button clicks, menu selections, or other UI controls with specific command objects. These commands execute the business logic associated with the UI action.

4. **Text Editor Actions (e.g., Copy, Paste, Undo)**:
   - Most text editors implement the Command pattern for actions such as **copy**, **paste**, and **undo**. Each of these actions is encapsulated in command objects that can be executed, undone, or redone.

---

### 584. **What are the examples of Interpreter Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Interpreter Design Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It is used to interpret and evaluate sentences in a language based on defined grammar. The pattern is typically used for building compilers or expression evaluators.

**Examples of Interpreter Design Pattern in JDK**:

1. **Regular Expressions**:
   - The regular expression classes in Java (`java.util.regex.Pattern`, `java.util.regex.Matcher`) are based on the Interpreter pattern. They interpret the regular expression language and apply it to strings for pattern matching.
   ```java
   Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("a*b");
   Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("aaab");
   if (matcher.matches()) {
       System.out.println("Match found!");
   }
   ```

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - A classic use case for the Interpreter pattern is for creating an expression evaluator. For example, the `javax.script.ScriptEngine` interface allows users to evaluate expressions written in different scripting languages (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.).
   ```java
   ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("JavaScript");
   Object result = engine.eval("2 + 2");
   ```

3. **SQL Parsing (JDBC)**:
   - Although not a direct implementation, SQL query parsers or custom query builders often make use of the Interpreter pattern. When you use a library to parse or generate SQL queries dynamically, it is typically an implementation of the Interpreter pattern.

---

### 585. **What are the examples of Mediator Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Mediator Design Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact. Instead of having each object refer to one another directly, they communicate with the mediator. This reduces dependencies between objects and promotes loose coupling.

**Examples of Mediator Design Pattern in JDK**:

1. **`javax.swing.JFrame` and `javax.swing.JPanel`**:
   - In Swing, the `JFrame` class acts as a mediator between different components (like `JTextField`, `JButton`, etc.). The `JFrame` manages the layout and communication between these components. The components do not need to interact with each other directly but instead communicate through the container (`JFrame`).

   ```java
   JFrame frame = new JFrame();
   JButton button = new JButton("Click Me");
   JTextField textField = new JTextField();
   frame.add(button);
   frame.add(textField);
   ```

2. **`java.util.concurrent.Executor`**:
   - The `Executor` framework serves as a mediator between the tasks to be executed and the thread pool. It decouples the task submission from the details of how each task will be executed.
   ```java
   Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
   executor.execute(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Task executed!");
       }
   });
   ```

3. **`javax.swing.JOptionPane`**:
   - `JOptionPane` is a dialog box that serves as a mediator between user input (such as button clicks or text input) and the main application logic. It handles the interaction between the user and the application without requiring direct communication between components.

4. **`Mediator Pattern in Chat Applications`**:
   - In chat applications, a central mediator (often referred to as a **ChatRoom**) facilitates communication between users without each user needing to be aware of other users' connections.


### 586. **What are the examples of Strategy Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm be selected at runtime based on the client's requirements.

**Examples of Strategy Design Pattern in JDK**:

1. **Sorting Algorithms (`java.util.Comparator`)**:
   - The `Comparator` interface in Java is a classic example of the Strategy pattern. You can define different strategies for sorting a collection of objects, such as sorting by name, by age, etc.
   ```java
   List<Person> persons = Arrays.asList(new Person("Alice", 30), new Person("Bob", 25));
   // Sort by name strategy
   persons.sort((p1, p2) -> p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName()));
   // Sort by age strategy
   persons.sort((p1, p2) -> Integer.compare(p1.getAge(), p2.getAge()));
   ```

2. **Java `java.util.Arrays.sort()`**:
   - The `Arrays.sort()` method can accept different strategies based on the comparator passed to it. It is essentially allowing different sorting strategies to be applied based on the context.
   ```java
   Integer[] numbers = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
   Arrays.sort(numbers, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b, a)); // Sorting in reverse order
   ```

3. **File Compression (e.g., `java.util.zip`)**:
   - When compressing files, Java can use different compression algorithms. The **Strategy Pattern** allows the implementation of different compression strategies (ZIP, GZIP, etc.) and selects the one to use at runtime.
   ```java
   // Strategy Pattern used to switch between compression types
   CompressionStrategy strategy = new ZipCompressionStrategy();
   strategy.compress(file);
   ```

---

### 587. **What are the examples of Visitor Design Pattern in JDK?**

The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used to represent an operation that can be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

**Examples of Visitor Design Pattern in JDK**:

1. **`java.nio.file.FileVisitor`**:
   - The `FileVisitor` interface is part of the NIO (New I/O) package in Java. It allows you to define operations that can be applied to file trees or directories. You can implement custom logic to visit files or directories using the `FileVisitor` interface.
   ```java
   Files.walkFileTree(Paths.get("/path/to/directory"), new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>() {
       @Override
       public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException {
           System.out.println("Visiting file: " + file);
           return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
       }
   });
   ```

2. **`java.lang.reflect.Visitor` (Custom Reflection-based Example)**:
   - While not directly named as such, you can create a Visitor pattern when you are using reflection to process classes and their fields, methods, etc., visiting each component and applying operations on them.

3. **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for Compiler Design**:
   - The Visitor pattern is commonly used in compilers when working with abstract syntax trees (AST). The visitor can perform specific actions on different node types (like parsing expressions or statements) without modifying the nodes themselves.

---

### 588. **How is the Decorator Design Pattern different from Proxy Pattern?**

Both the **Decorator Pattern** and the **Proxy Pattern** are structural design patterns, but they serve different purposes.

1. **Decorator Design Pattern**:
   - The **Decorator** pattern is used to **add functionality** to an object dynamically, without altering its structure. It extends the behavior of an object by wrapping it with a new object that provides additional features.
   - **Example**: Adding new methods or features to a class at runtime. A `BufferedInputStream` is an example in the JDK, where the original input stream functionality is decorated with the additional ability to buffer data.
   ```java
   InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
   BufferedInputStream bufferedStream = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
   ```

2. **Proxy Design Pattern**:
   - The **Proxy** pattern is used to **control access** to an object. A proxy object acts as a surrogate or placeholder, which controls access to the real object. This can be used for **lazy initialization**, **access control**, or **logging** purposes.
   - **Example**: The `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` class is used to create proxy instances that can intercept method calls on an interface and redirect them to a handler.
   ```java
   MyInterface proxy = (MyInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
       MyInterface.class.getClassLoader(),
       new Class[] { MyInterface.class },
       new MyInvocationHandler());
   ```

**Key Differences**:
- **Decorator** adds behavior or functionality, while a **Proxy** controls access or manages the object.
- A **Decorator** often extends the object's behavior, while a **Proxy** is used to manage interactions with the object (e.g., lazy loading, access control).

### 589. **What are the different scenarios to use Setter and Constructor-based Injection in Dependency Injection (DI) Design Pattern?**

In the **Dependency Injection (DI)** design pattern, there are two common ways to inject dependencies into a class: **constructor-based injection** and **setter-based injection**. Both have their own use cases and advantages.

#### **Constructor-based Injection**:
Constructor injection requires that all dependencies be passed to the constructor when an object is created. This ensures that the object is fully initialized with all its required dependencies at the time of creation.

**When to use Constructor-based Injection**:
1. **Mandatory Dependencies**: When the class cannot function without a certain dependency, it is best to use constructor injection. This guarantees that all required dependencies are provided at the time of object creation, ensuring immutability and consistency.
2. **Immutable Objects**: If your object is intended to be immutable after construction, constructor injection is a good choice because it ensures that dependencies are set once and cannot be modified afterward.
3. **Designing for Testability**: Constructor-based injection makes it easier to test the class because the dependencies are explicitly passed to the constructor, making them easier to mock or substitute during testing.

**Example**:
```java
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    // Constructor-based injection
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```

#### **Setter-based Injection**:
Setter injection involves passing dependencies through setter methods after the object has been constructed. This allows for optional dependencies and the ability to modify dependencies at runtime.

**When to use Setter-based Injection**:
1. **Optional Dependencies**: When a class can function without a dependency, or if the dependency is optional, setter injection is appropriate.
2. **Cyclic Dependencies**: If two or more objects depend on each other, setter injection can help break the circular dependency, as it allows for setting dependencies after the objects are created.
3. **Runtime Configuration**: If you need to configure the dependencies after the object has been created, setter injection allows you to change the dependencies at any time, which is useful for dynamic or configurable objects.

**Example**:
```java
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    // Setter-based injection
    public void setUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```

---

### Summary of Differences:
- **Constructor-based injection**: Useful for mandatory, immutable, and testable dependencies. Ensures that an object is always created with all its required dependencies.
- **Setter-based injection**: Useful for optional dependencies, breaking circular dependencies, and situations where you need to modify the dependencies after object creation.

### 590. **What are the different scenarios for using Proxy Design Pattern?**

The **Proxy Design Pattern** provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Proxies are commonly used to add extra functionality, such as logging, lazy initialization, access control, or monitoring. Here are different scenarios where you would use the **Proxy Design Pattern**:

1. **Lazy Initialization**:
   - When you want to delay the creation of an expensive object until it's actually needed, you can use a proxy to create the object only when necessary. This is useful when the object creation is resource-intensive.
   - **Example**: A database connection object that is only created when a user actually interacts with the database.

2. **Access Control**:
   - A proxy can control access to an object based on user permissions or other criteria. This can be useful in situations where you need to restrict or manage access to resources or operations.
   - **Example**: A security proxy that checks if a user is authorized to access certain features before delegating the request to the actual object.

3. **Remote Proxy**:
   - This is used when objects are located in different address spaces, such as when a client is accessing a remote object over a network. The proxy represents the remote object and delegates the requests to it, allowing clients to interact with the remote object as if it were local.
   - **Example**: A `RMI (Remote Method Invocation)` proxy in Java, where a client communicates with a remote object via a proxy.

4. **Virtual Proxy**:
   - Virtual proxies are used to manage objects that are expensive to create, such as large images or objects that represent a database record. The proxy can load the actual object when it's requested for the first time.
   - **Example**: A proxy representing a large image in a graphics application. The image is not loaded until it is actually displayed.

5. **Caching Proxy**:
   - Caching proxies store the results of expensive method calls to reduce the time spent recalculating or fetching data. This is useful when the results of method calls are unlikely to change often and you want to avoid unnecessary recomputation or network requests.
   - **Example**: A proxy that caches the result of database queries or HTTP requests.

6. **Logging Proxy**:
   - A proxy can be used to log method calls, parameters, and results for debugging or performance monitoring purposes.
   - **Example**: A proxy that logs all method invocations to track application behavior.

---

### 591. **What is the main difference between Adapter and Proxy Design Pattern?**

Both the **Adapter** and **Proxy** design patterns are structural patterns, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:

- **Adapter Pattern**:
  - The **Adapter** pattern is used to **convert the interface of a class** into another interface that a client expects. The adapter allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together. It doesn't modify the behavior of the object but instead provides a different interface to be used.
  - **Example Use Case**: When you have an existing system that expects a certain interface, but you have an external system with a different interface, you can create an adapter to make them compatible.
  
  **Key Characteristics**:
  - Converts one interface into another.
  - Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
  - Typically used when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems.

  **Example**: Converting a `List` to a `Set` or adapting an old logging system to work with a new interface.

- **Proxy Pattern**:
  - The **Proxy** pattern provides a **surrogate or placeholder** for another object to control access to it. The proxy can manage how and when the real object is accessed, and can be used for purposes like lazy initialization, security, or logging.
  - **Example Use Case**: When you want to control the access to an object, such as adding security checks, caching, or logging, without modifying the object itself.

  **Key Characteristics**:
  - Controls access to the real object.
  - Can perform additional tasks such as caching, logging, access control, or remote invocation.
  - Typically used for managing access or resource-intensive operations.

  **Example**: A virtual proxy for loading large images only when needed.

**Main Differences**:
- **Purpose**: The Adapter is for making interfaces compatible, while the Proxy is for controlling access to an object.
- **Behavior**: The Adapter doesn't change the behavior of the object but changes the way the interface looks to the client. The Proxy controls the access to the object and may add extra behavior (like lazy loading or caching).

---

### 592. **When will you use Adapter Design Pattern in Java?**

The **Adapter Design Pattern** is useful when you need to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It is typically used in the following scenarios:

1. **Integrating with Third-Party Libraries**:
   - When integrating an existing system with a third-party library or legacy code that does not conform to your expected interface, you can use an adapter to convert the incompatible interface into the one your system requires.
   - **Example**: If you're working with a third-party library that provides data in one format (e.g., JSON), and your system expects data in another format (e.g., XML), an adapter can help convert between them.

2. **Refactoring Legacy Code**:
   - If you're refactoring an existing codebase and need to adapt old code to a new interface without changing the old code, the adapter pattern allows you to keep the old code intact while making it compatible with the new code.
   - **Example**: Adapting a legacy API to a modern API without modifying the existing code.

3. **Different Frameworks with Incompatible Interfaces**:
   - When you're using two different frameworks or libraries that have different interface designs, an adapter can help bridge the gap between them.
   - **Example**: Adapting an old logging system (e.g., `Log4j`) to a newer one (e.g., `SLF4J`).

4. **Converting Between Different Data Formats**:
   - If your application consumes data from an external system in one format (e.g., CSV), but your internal system expects another format (e.g., XML), an adapter can be used to convert between them.

5. **Creating Common Interface for Diverse Classes**:
   - When you need to provide a unified interface for different classes that do not share a common superclass or interface, an adapter can provide this common interface.
   - **Example**: Converting different types of payment systems (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer) into a common interface.

---

### 593. **What are the examples of Adapter Design Pattern in JDK?**

In the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, there are several examples where the Adapter Design Pattern is used to allow incompatible interfaces to work together. Some of the key examples are:

1. **`java.util.Arrays.asList()`**:
   - The `asList()` method in the `Arrays` class converts an array into a `List` (which is an interface), allowing the array to be used as a `List`. This is an adapter because it allows an array (which does not implement the `List` interface) to be treated as a `List`.
   ```java
   String[] arr = {"a", "b", "c"};
   List<String> list = Arrays.asList(arr);
   ```

2. **`java.io.InputStreamReader` and `java.io.OutputStreamWriter`**:
   - These are adapters for converting byte streams to character streams and vice versa. They allow byte-oriented classes (like `FileInputStream`) to be used with character-oriented classes (like `BufferedReader`), enabling compatibility between different stream types.
   ```java
   InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
   Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream); // Adapting byte stream to character stream
   ```

3. **`java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList()`**:
   - The `unmodifiableList()` method adapts a modifiable list to a list that does not allow modifications. It provides an adapter around a regular list to enforce immutability.
   ```java
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add("Item1");
   List<String> unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
   ```

4. **`java.util.Iterator` and `Enumeration`**:
   - The `Enumeration` interface is an older interface for traversing collections, while `Iterator` is the more modern approach. The `Collections` class provides an adapter to convert an `Enumeration` to an `Iterator`.
   ```java
   Enumeration<String> enumeration = someList.elements();
   Iterator<String> iterator = Collections.list(enumeration).iterator();  // Adapting Enumeration to Iterator
   ```

### 594. **What is the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory Design Pattern?**

Both **Factory** and **Abstract Factory** are **creational design patterns** that deal with object creation, but they differ in their scope and use cases:

- **Factory Method Pattern**:
  - **Purpose**: The Factory Method pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It defines an interface for creating objects, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  - **Scope**: It is used when you want to create a single type of product, but the instantiation details can vary based on the subclass.
  - **Use Case**: It's typically used in scenarios where the system is expected to handle a class hierarchy, and the object creation should be delegated to subclasses.
  - **Example**: A `VehicleFactory` class that creates objects of different types of vehicles like `Car`, `Truck`, etc., but leaves the instantiation logic to the subclasses.

  ```java
  public abstract class Vehicle {
      public abstract void create();
  }

  public class Car extends Vehicle {
      public void create() {
          System.out.println("Creating a car");
      }
  }

  public abstract class VehicleFactory {
      public abstract Vehicle createVehicle();
  }

  public class CarFactory extends VehicleFactory {
      public Vehicle createVehicle() {
          return new Car();
      }
  }
  ```

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
  - **Purpose**: The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects, without specifying their concrete classes. It involves multiple factories that are responsible for creating different product families.
  - **Scope**: It is used when you need to create a set of related objects or products. You can switch between families of products but still maintain the integrity of the product family.
  - **Use Case**: It's used when a system needs to create different types of objects that are related and need to work together. For example, creating a family of UI components such as buttons, text boxes, etc., that must be consistent in style.
  - **Example**: A `GUIFactory` that creates different GUI components (buttons, textboxes, etc.) based on the operating system (Windows, Mac).

  ```java
  public interface Button {
      void render();
  }

  public class WindowsButton implements Button {
      public void render() {
          System.out.println("Rendering a Windows button");
      }
  }

  public class MacButton implements Button {
      public void render() {
          System.out.println("Rendering a Mac button");
      }
  }

  public interface GUIFactory {
      Button createButton();
  }

  public class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
      public Button createButton() {
          return new WindowsButton();
      }
  }

  public class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
      public Button createButton() {
          return new MacButton();
      }
  }
  ```

**Key Differences**:
- **Scope**: The Factory method is used to create a single object, while the Abstract Factory is used to create families of related objects.
- **Complexity**: Abstract Factory is more complex than Factory because it involves multiple factories working together.

### 595. **What is Open/Closed Design Principle in Software Engineering?**

The **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** is one of the five **SOLID principles** of object-oriented design. It states that:

- **"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**

This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without modifying its existing code. The idea is to design systems in a way that allows them to be extended (by adding new code) without changing the existing, tested, and stable code.

**Key Ideas**:
- **Open for Extension**: You can extend the behavior of a class by adding new functionality or modifying existing behavior.
- **Closed for Modification**: Once a class is written, you shouldn't need to change it; instead, you should extend it with new classes.

**Example**: If you have a payment system that initially supports only `CreditCardPayment`, but later you want to add `PayPalPayment`, you should add this new payment type without changing the original payment system class.

---

### 596. **What is SOLID Design Principle?**

**SOLID** is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented programming and design, which help create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software systems. These principles are:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility. If a class has more than one responsibility, those responsibilities should be separated.
   - **Example**: A `UserService` class should only handle user-related logic, not also manage user data storage.

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality to a class without modifying its existing code.
   - **Example**: You can add new shapes (like `Circle`, `Rectangle`) to a drawing system without modifying the existing drawing logic.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
   - **Example**: A `Square` class should be a subclass of `Rectangle` without changing the behavior of the `Rectangle`.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It is better to have several small, specific interfaces than one large, general-purpose interface.
   - **Example**: Instead of having a single interface `Animal` with methods `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `fly()`, you should create separate interfaces for `Flyable`, `Sleepable`, and `Eatable`.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Example**: Instead of a `Car` class directly depending on a `GasolineEngine`, you should have a `Vehicle` interface that `Car` can depend on, which can then be implemented by any engine (e.g., `GasolineEngine`, `ElectricEngine`).

### 597. **What is Builder Design Pattern?**

The **Builder Design Pattern** is a **creational design pattern** that allows you to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, which allows you to create different representations of the same type of object.

The main idea is to allow the construction of an object by specifying its type and content. The pattern is particularly useful when you need to create an object with a large number of configuration options and want to avoid a constructor with many parameters.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: It separates the construction logic from the representation of the object.
- **Improves Readability**: Using a builder, you can create objects with a fluent API, making the code easier to read.
- **Avoids Telescoping Constructor**: The Builder pattern avoids constructors with many parameters, which can be hard to manage and error-prone.

**Example**:

```java
public class Computer {
    private String CPU;
    private String RAM;
    private String storage;
    private String graphicsCard;

    private Computer(Builder builder) {
        this.CPU = builder.CPU;
        this.RAM = builder.RAM;
        this.storage = builder.storage;
        this.graphicsCard = builder.graphicsCard;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String CPU;
        private String RAM;
        private String storage;
        private String graphicsCard;

        public Builder(String CPU, String RAM) {
            this.CPU = CPU;
            this.RAM = RAM;
        }

        public Builder setStorage(String storage) {
            this.storage = storage;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setGraphicsCard(String graphicsCard) {
            this.graphicsCard = graphicsCard;
            return this;
        }

        public Computer build() {
            return new Computer(this);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Computer [CPU=" + CPU + ", RAM=" + RAM + ", storage=" + storage + ", graphicsCard=" + graphicsCard + "]";
    }
}

class TestBuilder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer computer = new Computer.Builder("Intel i9", "16GB")
            .setStorage("1TB SSD")
            .setGraphicsCard("NVIDIA GTX 3080")
            .build();
        System.out.println(computer);
    }
}
```

**In the example**:
- The `Computer` class has a private constructor, and the `Builder` class provides a way to set the optional fields (e.g., storage, graphics card).
- The `build()` method finally constructs and returns the `Computer` object.

### 598. **What are the different categories of Design Patterns used in Object-Oriented Design?**

Design patterns in object-oriented design are categorized based on their functionality and the problem they aim to solve. The three main categories of design patterns are:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**:
   - **Purpose**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. They abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and dynamic.
   - **Examples**: 
     - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
     - **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
     - **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
     - **Builder**: Allows creating complex objects step by step.
     - **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

2. **Structural Design Patterns**:
   - **Purpose**: These patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. They help ensure that classes and objects work together efficiently.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.
     - **Bridge**: Decouples abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently.
     - **Composite**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
     - **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
     - **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
     - **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and managing a large number of objects.
     - **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**:
   - **Purpose**: These patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact, and the delegation of responsibilities.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers, where each handler either processes the request or passes it on.
     - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
     - **Interpreter**: Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions.
     - **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
     - **Mediator**: Defines an object that controls communication between a set of objects, helping to reduce dependencies between them.
     - **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
     - **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects such that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
     - **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
     - **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
     - **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
     - **Visitor**: Allows adding new operations to existing class structures without modifying them.

---

### 599. **What is the design pattern suitable to access elements of a Collection?**

The **Iterator** design pattern is the most suitable pattern to access elements of a collection. It provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

- **Purpose**: The Iterator pattern allows the traversal of a collection of objects without exposing its internal structure (such as an array, list, etc.). It provides a standard interface for accessing elements.
- **Example in Java**:
  The Java Collections framework provides an `Iterator` interface that can be used to traverse through elements in collections like `List`, `Set`, etc.

  ```java
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.Iterator;

  public class IteratorExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
          list.add("One");
          list.add("Two");
          list.add("Three");

          Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
          while (iterator.hasNext()) {
              System.out.println(iterator.next());
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 600. **How can we implement Producer-Consumer design pattern in Java?**

The **Producer-Consumer pattern** is a classic synchronization design pattern that involves two types of threads: **Producers**, which produce data, and **Consumers**, which consume the data. The pattern is used when the producers and consumers operate at different speeds.

In Java, this pattern can be implemented using **BlockingQueue**, which handles synchronization automatically.

#### Implementation:

- **Producer**: Puts data into the queue.
- **Consumer**: Takes data from the queue.
- **BlockingQueue**: Ensures that the producer waits if the queue is full and the consumer waits if the queue is empty.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class Producer implements Runnable {
    private BlockingQueue<Integer> queue;

    public Producer(BlockingQueue<Integer> queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                queue.put(i);
                System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable {
    private BlockingQueue<Integer> queue;

    public Consumer(BlockingQueue<Integer> queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                int value = queue.take();
                System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(queue));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(queue));

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Producer` adds items to the queue, and the `Consumer` removes them.
- The `BlockingQueue` ensures thread synchronization and handles conditions like waiting when the queue is empty or full.

---

### 601. **What design pattern is suitable to add new features to an existing object?**

The **Decorator Design Pattern** is the most suitable pattern to add new features to an existing object dynamically. This pattern allows you to "decorate" an object with additional functionality without altering its original code.

- **Purpose**: The Decorator pattern enables extending an object's behavior without modifying the object itself. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Example**: Imagine a `Car` class, and you want to add additional features like a sunroof or leather seats to the car. You can decorate the `Car` with additional features dynamically at runtime.

```java
interface Car {
    void assemble();
}

class BasicCar implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Basic Car.");
    }
}

class CarDecorator implements Car {
    protected Car decoratedCar;

    public CarDecorator(Car car) {
        this.decoratedCar = car;
    }

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        this.decoratedCar.assemble();
    }
}

class SportsCar extends CarDecorator {
    public SportsCar(Car car) {
        super(car);
    }

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        super.assemble();
        System.out.println("Adding features of Sports Car.");
    }
}

class LuxuryCar extends CarDecorator {
    public LuxuryCar(Car car) {
        super(car);
    }

    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        super.assemble();
        System.out.println("Adding features of Luxury Car.");
    }
}

public class DecoratorPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car sportsCar = new SportsCar(new BasicCar());
        sportsCar.assemble();

        System.out.println("\n*****");

        Car sportsLuxuryCar = new SportsCar(new LuxuryCar(new BasicCar()));
        sportsLuxuryCar.assemble();
    }
}
```

---

### 602. **Which design pattern can be used when to decouple abstraction from the implementation?**

The **Bridge Design Pattern** is used to decouple abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

- **Purpose**: The Bridge pattern separates the abstraction (what is done) from the implementation (how it is done). It is useful when both the abstractions and their implementations should vary independently.
- **Example**: A drawing application where the shape (abstraction) can be independent of the drawing method (implementation), which can change depending on the platform (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux).

```java
interface DrawingAPI {
    void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
}

class DrawingAPI1 implements DrawingAPI {
    public void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
        System.out.println("API1 drawing circle at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with radius " + radius);
    }
}

class DrawingAPI2 implements DrawingAPI {
    public void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
        System.out.println("API2 drawing circle at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with radius " + radius);
    }
}

abstract class Shape {
    protected DrawingAPI drawingAPI;

    protected Shape(DrawingAPI drawingAPI) {
        this.drawingAPI = drawingAPI;
    }

    public abstract void draw();
    public abstract void resize(double percentage);
}

class CircleShape extends Shape {
    private double x, y, radius;

    public CircleShape(double x, double y, double radius, DrawingAPI drawingAPI) {
        super(drawingAPI);
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        drawingAPI.drawCircle

(x, y, radius);
    }

    @Override
    public void resize(double percentage) {
        radius *= percentage;
    }
}

public class BridgePatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = new CircleShape(1, 2, 3, new DrawingAPI1());
        shape1.draw();

        Shape shape2 = new CircleShape(5, 7, 10, new DrawingAPI2());
        shape2.draw();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Shape` class is decoupled from the drawing method. The `DrawingAPI` defines the abstraction, and different implementations (`DrawingAPI1` and `DrawingAPI2`) provide the actual drawing method.

### 603. **Which is the design pattern used in Android applications?**

In Android applications, several design patterns are used to manage different tasks and improve code structure. The most commonly used design patterns include:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Often used to manage shared resources like a database connection or a network manager. This ensures that only one instance of an object is created and used globally across the app.

2. **Observer Pattern**: Used extensively in Android for handling events or data changes. The `LiveData` and `Observer` classes in the Android Architecture Components are an example of this pattern, where components (observers) are notified about data changes.

3. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: While not strictly adhered to, Android applications often follow some form of the MVC pattern where the **View** is the UI (e.g., `Activity` or `Fragment`), the **Model** is the data layer, and the **Controller** is the logic handling user interactions.

4. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: This is one of the most popular architecture patterns for modern Android apps. The **ViewModel** is responsible for managing the UI-related data and acts as a middle layer between the **View** (Activity/Fragment) and **Model** (data source or API).

5. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating objects, especially in scenarios where the type of object needs to be decided at runtime, for example, the instantiation of various UI elements based on user input.

6. **Adapter Pattern**: Often used in Android for converting between different formats of data. For example, `RecyclerView.Adapter` is used to bind data to a `RecyclerView`.

7. **Command Pattern**: Sometimes used in Android for structuring requests like button clicks or other events. The use of `AsyncTask` or custom `Runnable` tasks is an example.

8. **Decorator Pattern**: Can be used to extend functionality in Android, such as adding features to views (e.g., `CustomViews` or `Drawable` objects).

9. **Builder Pattern**: Frequently used for constructing complex objects step by step, for example, when building `Intent` objects or complex `AlertDialog` configurations.

---

### 604. **How can we prevent users from creating more than one instance of a singleton object by using `clone()` method?**

To prevent users from cloning a Singleton object in Java, we need to override the `clone()` method and make it throw a `CloneNotSupportedException`. This ensures that an attempt to clone the Singleton object will fail.

Example:

```java
public class Singleton implements Cloneable {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Override clone method to prevent cloning
    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Cloning is not allowed for Singleton class");
    }
}
```

- By overriding the `clone()` method and throwing `CloneNotSupportedException`, you ensure that users cannot create a second instance of the Singleton object via cloning.

---

### 605. **What is the use of Interceptor design pattern?**

The **Interceptor Design Pattern** is used to add additional behavior or functionality to an object without modifying its code. It is typically used to perform operations like logging, authentication, validation, or transaction management in a modular way, separate from the core logic of the system.

- **Usage**: Interceptors are often used in frameworks such as Java EE (Enterprise JavaBeans), Spring, and HTTP request handling systems like Servlet filters.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - **Logging**: Log every method call or HTTP request and response.
  - **Security**: Check for user authentication and authorization before allowing access to certain methods or resources.
  - **Transaction Management**: Start and commit transactions around certain operations.
  
Example in **Spring**:
```java
@Component
public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        // Perform logging before the controller method is executed
        System.out.println("Request intercepted: " + request.getRequestURI());
        return true;  // Proceed to the controller method
    }

    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
        // You can perform post-processing here, after controller execution but before view rendering
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) throws Exception {
        // Cleanup operations after request is completed
    }
}
```

- In this example, the `LoggingInterceptor` is added to the Spring MVC request handling lifecycle to log incoming requests.

---

### 606. **What are the Architectural patterns that you have used?**

The architectural patterns commonly used in software development, including Java and Android applications, include:

1. **Layered (N-tier) Architecture**:
   - **Use**: This pattern is used to separate the application into distinct layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access layers.
   - **Example**: In web applications, you might have a web layer (UI), service layer (business logic), and data layer (database access).

2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
   - **Use**: Separates concerns into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic that handles input and updates the model or view).
   - **Example**: Web applications using frameworks like Spring MVC or JavaFX apps.

3. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**:
   - **Use**: This pattern is commonly used in modern Android apps where the **ViewModel** holds data that can be observed and used to update the **View**. It is particularly effective in data-binding scenarios.
   - **Example**: Android apps using **LiveData** or **Jetpack Compose**.

4. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - **Use**: Decomposes an application into a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service has its own functionality and can be deployed independently.
   - **Example**: Used in large-scale, cloud-based applications where different modules like authentication, payment, and inventory are implemented as separate services.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - **Use**: This pattern relies on events (data changes, user actions) to trigger behavior within the system. It’s highly asynchronous and is useful in highly scalable systems.
   - **Example**: Used in systems that require real-time updates like stock trading platforms, or event-based systems in microservices.

6. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - **Use**: This is the basic architecture for distributed applications where clients (UI or users) interact with servers (data or business logic).
   - **Example**: Traditional web applications or REST APIs.

7. **Repository Pattern**:
   - **Use**: This pattern abstracts data access logic, making it easier to work with data sources (databases, APIs) in a decoupled manner.
   - **Example**: Used to manage CRUD operations on the data layer in an application.

8. **Singleton Architecture**:
   - **Use**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
   - **Example**: Used for managing shared resources such as a configuration class, database connection pool, or logging.

9. **Proxy Pattern**:
   - **Use**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used for lazy loading, access control, or caching.
   - **Example**: Used in Hibernate’s lazy loading mechanism, or in network communication where an object in one system is accessed via a proxy in another system.

10. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
    - **Use**: This pattern is used in large applications where services (functions or processes) are exposed via interfaces and consumed via APIs.
    - **Example**: Web services in enterprise applications.


### 607. **What are the popular uses of Façade design pattern?**

The **Façade Design Pattern** is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem or set of interfaces. It acts as a wrapper that hides the complexities of the system and provides a higher-level interface to make it easier for clients to interact with.

#### Popular uses of the Façade pattern include:

1. **Simplifying Complex Subsystems**: When dealing with a system that involves multiple classes or subsystems, the Façade pattern provides a simpler interface to the client, allowing access to the functionality without needing to understand the underlying details.
   - **Example**: A library system where clients only need to interact with a single API, but internally the system involves multiple subsystems like database access, authentication, and reporting.

2. **Integrating Multiple Systems**: Façade helps in integrating different subsystems into a single entry point, which is especially useful when multiple modules or services need to work together.
   - **Example**: In a home automation system, the Façade could provide a unified interface to control lighting, security, HVAC, and entertainment systems.

3. **Decoupling Clients from Subsystems**: Clients should not be tightly coupled to the inner workings of complex subsystems. By using the Façade pattern, we ensure that the client remains decoupled from those subsystems.
   - **Example**: In a banking system, a façade might allow users to interact with a single `BankingFacade` to perform operations such as checking balances, transferring funds, and accessing transaction history, without directly dealing with the underlying service layers.

4. **Libraries and APIs**: The Façade pattern is often used in third-party libraries and APIs to offer an easier-to-use interface to developers, masking any unnecessary complexity or providing convenience methods.
   - **Example**: A logging system that provides a simple interface for logging messages, while internally supporting multiple log levels, output formats, and destinations.

---

### 608. **What is the difference between Builder design pattern and Factory design pattern?**

Both **Builder** and **Factory** patterns are creational patterns used to create objects, but they have different purposes and use cases:

1. **Builder Design Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects by separating the construction process from the actual object representation. It allows you to create different types of objects step by step with a flexible configuration, typically when the object needs to be created with multiple variations or configurations.
   - **Use case**: When an object needs to be created with a variety of optional attributes and when the object creation process involves several steps.
   - **Example**: Building a `Car` object with various options like color, engine type, and transmission, where the builder helps configure the car without needing to specify all attributes at once.

   ```java
   public class Car {
       private String engine;
       private String color;
       private String transmission;

       // Getters and setters...
   }

   public class CarBuilder {
       private String engine;
       private String color;
       private String transmission;

       public CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
           this.engine = engine;
           return this;
       }

       public CarBuilder setColor(String color) {
           this.color = color;
           return this;
       }

       public CarBuilder setTransmission(String transmission) {
           this.transmission = transmission;
           return this;
       }

       public Car build() {
           Car car = new Car();
           car.setEngine(engine);
           car.setColor(color);
           car.setTransmission(transmission);
           return car;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Factory Design Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created. It provides a method to instantiate objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
   - **Use case**: When the type of object to be created is determined at runtime, or when you want to provide different types of objects without exposing the instantiation logic.
   - **Example**: A vehicle factory that produces either a `Car` or a `Truck` based on user input, but hides the actual implementation of creating these objects.

   ```java
   public class VehicleFactory {
       public Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
           if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
               return new Car();
           } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("truck")) {
               return new Truck();
           }
           return null;
       }
   }
   ```

**Key Difference**:
- **Builder** is used for constructing complex objects step by step and allows more flexibility in how an object is created.
- **Factory** is used for creating objects based on input or conditions, typically used when the exact class of the object is determined at runtime.

### 609. **What is Memento design pattern?**

The **Memento Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object’s state to be captured and restored at a later time, without violating encapsulation. It is useful when you want to provide the ability to undo or rollback an operation or when you want to store and later retrieve an object's state.

#### Components:
1. **Memento**: Stores the state of the object.
2. **Originator**: The object whose state is being saved and restored.
3. **Caretaker**: Responsible for storing and managing the memento, without altering the object’s state.

#### Example Use Case:
A text editor where you can undo and redo actions. The state of the document (e.g., the content) is saved in a memento, and the editor can return to previous states when the user requests undo.

Example:
```java
class Memento {
    private String state;

    public Memento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}

class Originator {
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public Memento saveStateToMemento() {
        return new Memento(state);
    }

    public void getStateFromMemento(Memento memento) {
        state = memento.getState();
    }
}

class Caretaker {
    private Memento memento;

    public void saveMemento(Memento memento) {
        this.memento = memento;
    }

    public Memento getMemento() {
        return memento;
    }
}
```

### 610. **What is an AntiPattern?**

An **AntiPattern** is a common but ineffective solution to a problem that appears to be a good idea at first but often leads to poor results. It’s a pattern that seems attractive, but when applied, it leads to negative consequences or worsens the problem it tries to solve.

#### Examples of AntiPatterns:
1. **God Object**: A single class that takes on too many responsibilities, making it overly complex and difficult to maintain.
2. **Spaghetti Code**: Code that is tangled and difficult to understand, often due to a lack of proper structure or modularization.
3. **Golden Hammer**: Using a familiar tool or solution for every problem, even when it’s not the best fit.
4. **Cut-and-Paste Programming**: Reusing code by copying and pasting it, which leads to redundancy and maintenance challenges.

### 611. **What is a Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern?**

The **Data Access Object (DAO)** pattern is a structural pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistent storage. It separates the business logic from the persistence layer, allowing for easier maintenance and swapping of data sources without affecting other parts of the application.

#### Key Benefits:
- **Separation of concerns**: It keeps the data access logic separate from the business logic.
- **Flexibility**: The data access mechanism can be easily changed (e.g., from a relational database to a NoSQL database) without affecting the rest of the application.
- **Simplification**: DAO simplifies database interactions by abstracting the complexity of persistence logic.

#### Example:
```java
public interface UserDao {
    void save(User user);
    User find(int id);
    void update(User user);
    void delete(int id);
}

public class UserDaoImpl implements UserDao {
    // Database connection setup, CRUD operations...
    @Override
    public void save(User user) {
        // Implement save logic
    }

    @Override
    public User find(int id) {
        // Implement find logic
        return new User(); // Placeholder return
    }

    @Override
    public void update(User user) {
        // Implement update logic
    }

    @Override
    public void delete(int id) {
        // Implement delete logic
    }
}
```
