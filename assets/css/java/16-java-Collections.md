# Top 1000 Java Interview Question & Answers

## Java Collection

### 177. **What is the difference between Collection and Collections Framework in Java?**

- **Collection**: 
   - **Collection** is an interface in Java, which is the root interface of the entire collection framework.
   - It defines basic methods for adding, removing, and checking elements within a collection (like `add()`, `remove()`, `size()`, etc.).
   - It is the parent of interfaces such as **Set**, **List**, and **Queue**, which define specific types of collections.

- **Collections Framework**:
   - The **Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that implement various data structures and algorithms, like **ArrayList**, **HashSet**, **HashMap**, etc.
   - The framework provides ready-made implementations of the **Collection** interface and other interfaces.
   - It includes classes like **Collection**, **List**, **Set**, **Map**, and utility classes like **Collections** for performing operations on collections (like sorting, shuffling, reversing, etc.).

### 178. **What are the main benefits of the Collections Framework in Java?**

The **Collections Framework** in Java provides several benefits:

1. **Unified Architecture**: It provides a single set of interfaces (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) and classes to represent different types of collections, which makes it easier to work with various data structures.
   
2. **Reusability**: The collection classes are already implemented, so developers don't need to write their own data structure code. They can reuse existing classes such as `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.
   
3. **Performance**: The framework includes high-performance implementations for common data structures and algorithms, optimized for different types of use cases.
   
4. **Interoperability**: The collections framework allows for seamless interoperability between different data structures, reducing the complexity of working with heterogeneous data types.

5. **Thread Safety**: Some collection classes like `Vector`, `Hashtable`, and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` provide thread-safe versions of the data structures, useful in multi-threaded environments.

6. **Extensibility**: New data structures can be added to the framework by implementing the `Collection` interface or any of its subinterfaces.

### 179. **What is the root interface of Collection hierarchy in Java?**

The **root interface** of the **Collection hierarchy** in Java is the **`Collection`** interface. All other interfaces in the collection framework, such as `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`, extend from the `Collection` interface.

### 180. **What are the main differences between Collection and Collections?**

- **Collection**:
   - **Collection** is an interface in Java, which is the root of the collection framework. It defines a set of methods for adding, removing, and checking elements in a collection.
   - Examples of interfaces that extend `Collection` are `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, and `Deque`.

- **Collections**:
   - **Collections** is a utility class that belongs to the `java.util` package and provides static methods for operating on or manipulating collections, such as sorting, reversing, and shuffling.
   - It is not an interface but a class that provides methods like `sort()`, `shuffle()`, `reverse()`, and more, to operate on collections.
   - **`Collections`** is commonly used to perform operations on objects that implement the **`Collection`** interface.

### 181. **What are the Thread-safe classes in Java Collections framework?**

In the Java Collections framework, several thread-safe classes provide synchronized operations for multi-threaded environments. Some of the important thread-safe classes include:

1. **Vector**: 
   - A legacy class that implements a growable array of objects. It is synchronized and thread-safe but has performance overhead due to synchronization.

2. **Hashtable**:
   - A legacy class that implements a hash table, where keys and values are stored in a synchronized manner. It is thread-safe but less efficient compared to `HashMap` in modern Java.

3. **Stack**:
   - A subclass of `Vector`, representing a stack of objects with synchronized methods for pushing and popping elements.

4. **CopyOnWriteArrayList**:
   - A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`. It allows multiple threads to read concurrently without synchronization but creates a new copy of the array for modifications, which makes it ideal for scenarios where reads dominate.

5. **CopyOnWriteArraySet**:
   - Similar to `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, it is a thread-safe variant of `Set`. It is particularly useful when there are frequent reads and few writes.

6. **ConcurrentHashMap**:
   - A more efficient, thread-safe version of `HashMap`. It provides finer granularity of locking (segmentation), allowing multiple threads to read and write concurrently without much contention.

7. **BlockingQueue implementations** (e.g., `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`):
   - These classes are thread-safe and are used for inter-thread communication. They include blocking operations, such as `take()` and `put()`, which block the thread until an item is available or space is available in the queue.

8. **ConcurrentLinkedQueue** and **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**:
   - These are lock-free and thread-safe queue and deque implementations that allow for concurrent access and modifications.

In general, **ConcurrentHashMap**, **CopyOnWriteArrayList**, and other classes in the `java.util.concurrent` package are preferred over the older synchronized collections like `Vector` and `Hashtable` for thread-safety, due to their better performance and scalability.

Here are the answers to the Java-related questions:

### 182. **How will you efficiently remove elements while iterating a Collection?**

To efficiently remove elements while iterating a collection, you should use the **Iterator**'s `remove()` method. This approach avoids **ConcurrentModificationException**, which occurs if you try to remove elements from a collection while directly iterating over it with a for-each loop.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"));
Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    String element = iterator.next();
    if (element.equals("C")) {
        iterator.remove(); // Efficient and safe way to remove elements
    }
}
System.out.println(list); // Output: [A, B, D, E]
```

Alternatively, in Java 8 and later, you can also use **`removeIf()`** for more concise code:
```java
list.removeIf(item -> item.equals("C"));
```

### 183. **How will you convert a List into an array of integers like `int[]`?**

You can convert a `List<Integer>` into an `int[]` using Java 8's **`stream()`** and **`mapToInt()`** methods, or by using `toArray()` with a specified generator.

Example using **`mapToInt()`**:
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int[] array = list.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Alternatively, you can use a loop:
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int[] array = new int[list.size()];
for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
    array[i] = list.get(i);
}
```

### 184. **How will you convert an array of primitive integers `int[]` to a List collection?**

You can convert an `int[]` to a `List<Integer>` by first converting the array to a stream and then collecting it into a list.

Example:
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
List<Integer> list = Arrays.stream(array)    // Convert int[] to IntStream
                           .boxed()           // Convert each int to Integer
                           .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Collect into a List
System.out.println(list); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Alternatively, using a loop:
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i : array) {
    list.add(i);
}
```

### 185. **How will you run a filter on a Collection?**

To filter a collection, you can use the **Stream API** in Java 8 and later. The `filter()` method is used to filter the elements based on a condition (predicate).

Example:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry");
List<String> filteredList = list.stream()
                                .filter(s -> s.startsWith("b"))  // Filter strings starting with 'b'
                                .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(filteredList); // Output: [banana]
```

This code demonstrates filtering elements of a list based on a predicate. You can replace the condition inside the `filter()` method with any logical condition depending on your use case.

Here are the answers to your Java questions:

### 186. **How will you convert a List to a Set?**

You can convert a `List` to a `Set` by creating a new `Set` and passing the `List` to the constructor of the `Set`. This automatically removes any duplicate elements since `Set` does not allow duplicates.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B");
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(list);  // Convert List to Set, duplicates removed
System.out.println(set);  // Output: [A, B, C, D]
```

### 187. **How will you remove duplicate elements from an ArrayList?**

To remove duplicates from an `ArrayList`, you can convert the `ArrayList` to a `Set`, and then back to a `List` because `Set` automatically removes duplicates.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B"));
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(list);  // Remove duplicates by converting to Set
list = new ArrayList<>(set);  // Convert back to List if needed
System.out.println(list);  // Output: [A, B, C, D]
```

Alternatively, you can use **`removeIf()`** in Java 8 and later to remove duplicates:
```java
list.removeIf(i -> list.indexOf(i) != list.lastIndexOf(i));
```

### 188. **How can you maintain a Collection with elements in Sorted order?**

You can maintain a collection in sorted order by using a `SortedSet` or `SortedMap`, such as `TreeSet` or `TreeMap`. These classes automatically keep the elements sorted.

Example using `TreeSet`:
```java
Set<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(5);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(3);
System.out.println(sortedSet);  // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

Alternatively, for `List`, you can use `Collections.sort()` to manually sort the list:
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(5, 1, 3));
Collections.sort(list);  // Sorts the list in ascending order
System.out.println(list);  // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

If you want to keep elements sorted dynamically as they are added, use a `PriorityQueue`, which maintains elements in a sorted order based on their natural ordering or a comparator.

### 189. **What is the difference between `Collections.emptyList()` and creating a new instance of Collection?**

- **`Collections.emptyList()`**:
   - It returns an **immutable empty list**, meaning you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in the list. It is often used to represent a list with no elements.
   - It's a singleton, so it doesn’t create a new instance every time it's called, improving performance and memory efficiency.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> emptyList = Collections.emptyList();  // Immutable empty list
   ```

- **Creating a new instance**:
   - When you create a new `List` using `new ArrayList<>()` or other constructors, it creates a new, **mutable** list that you can modify. The list may initially be empty, but you can add elements to it.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();  // Mutable list
   list.add("Element");
   ```

### 190. **How will you copy elements from a Source List to another list?**

You can copy elements from a source list to another list using the `addAll()` method or by using **`Collections.copy()`** if you want to copy elements into an existing list.

1. Using `addAll()`:
```java
List<String> sourceList = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
List<String> destinationList = new ArrayList<>();
destinationList.addAll(sourceList);  // Copy elements from source to destination
System.out.println(destinationList);  // Output: [A, B, C]
```

2. Using `Collections.copy()` (requires the destination list to have the same or larger size than the source list):
```java
List<String> sourceList = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
List<String> destinationList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("X", "Y", "Z"));
Collections.copy(destinationList, sourceList);  // Copy elements into destination list
System.out.println(destinationList);  // Output: [A, B, C]
```

In this case, `Collections.copy()` will overwrite the elements in the destination list with the elements from the source list.

Here are the answers to your Java questions:

### 191. **What are the Java Collection classes that implement the `List` interface?**

The `List` interface in Java is implemented by several classes. Some of the most commonly used ones include:

1. **`ArrayList`** – A resizable array implementation of the `List` interface, which allows fast random access to elements.
2. **`LinkedList`** – A doubly linked list implementation of the `List` interface, which allows efficient insertion and removal of elements.
3. **`Vector`** – A legacy class that implements the `List` interface and is synchronized (generally, it is recommended to use `ArrayList` over `Vector`).
4. **`Stack`** – A subclass of `Vector` that represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.
5. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`** – A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` in the `java.util.concurrent` package, which is optimized for cases where read operations vastly outnumber write operations.

Example:
```java
List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> list2 = new LinkedList<>();
```

### 192. **What are the Java Collection classes that implement the `Set` interface?**

The `Set` interface is implemented by several classes. The most commonly used ones include:

1. **`HashSet`** – A `Set` implementation backed by a hash table, which does not guarantee any order of elements.
2. **`LinkedHashSet`** – A `Set` implementation that maintains the insertion order of elements.
3. **`TreeSet`** – A `Set` implementation that stores elements in a sorted order, based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
4. **`CopyOnWriteArraySet`** – A thread-safe variant of `HashSet` in the `java.util.concurrent` package, optimized for cases where read operations vastly outnumber write operations.

Example:
```java
Set<String> set1 = new HashSet<>();
Set<String> set2 = new TreeSet<>();
```

### 193. **What is the difference between an `Iterator` and `ListIterator` in Java?**

- **`Iterator`**:
  - It is used to iterate over any `Collection` (including `List`, `Set`, etc.).
  - It can only iterate **forward** through the collection.
  - Methods: `hasNext()`, `next()`, `remove()`.
  - It does not support operations like modifying the list during iteration (except removal).
  
- **`ListIterator`**:
  - It is a more powerful version of `Iterator`, specifically for `List` collections.
  - It can iterate **forward and backward** through the list.
  - Methods: `hasNext()`, `next()`, `hasPrevious()`, `previous()`, `add()`, `set()`, `remove()`.
  - It allows **modification** of the list (i.e., adding, removing, or updating elements) during iteration.

Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C"));
Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
ListIterator<String> listIterator = list.listIterator();
```

### 194. **What is the difference between `Iterator` and `Enumeration`?**

- **`Iterator`**:
  - It was introduced in Java 1.2 as part of the **Java Collections Framework**.
  - It is used for iterating over any collection (`List`, `Set`, etc.).
  - It allows **removal** of elements during iteration with the `remove()` method.
  - It provides `hasNext()`, `next()`, and `remove()` methods.
  
- **`Enumeration`**:
  - It is an older interface from Java 1.0, used for iterating over legacy collections such as `Vector` and `Stack`.
  - It does **not support removal** of elements during iteration.
  - It provides `hasMoreElements()` and `nextElement()` methods.
  - It is considered obsolete and has been replaced by `Iterator` in newer collections.

### Key Differences:
- `Iterator` can remove elements during iteration, but `Enumeration` cannot.
- `Iterator` is part of the Java Collections Framework (introduced in Java 1.2), while `Enumeration` is part of the legacy collection framework (Java 1.0).
- `Iterator` provides more flexibility (e.g., it works with both `List` and `Set`, and allows removal of elements), while `Enumeration` is more limited in functionality.

Example:
```java
Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C"));
Enumeration<String> enumeration = vector.elements();  // Enumeration
Iterator<String> iterator = vector.iterator();        // Iterator
```

### 195. **What is the difference between an `ArrayList` and a `LinkedList` data structure?**

**`ArrayList`** and **`LinkedList`** are both implementations of the `List` interface, but they differ in terms of their internal structure and performance characteristics:

- **Internal Structure**:
  - **`ArrayList`**: Internally uses a dynamic array. Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - **`LinkedList`**: Internally uses a doubly linked list. Each element (node) contains a reference to the previous and next elements.

- **Access Time**:
  - **`ArrayList`**: Provides **constant time** O(1) access for indexed elements (random access).
  - **`LinkedList`**: Provides **linear time** O(n) access for indexed elements as it must traverse the list to find the element.

- **Insertion/Deletion**:
  - **`ArrayList`**: Inserting or removing elements in the middle or at the beginning of the list requires shifting the subsequent elements, which can be slow (O(n)).
  - **`LinkedList`**: Inserting or removing elements at the beginning, middle, or end is efficient (O(1) for adding/removing nodes once the location is known).

- **Memory Usage**:
  - **`ArrayList`**: Requires contiguous memory, which may lead to inefficient memory usage if the array grows or shrinks frequently.
  - **`LinkedList`**: Requires more memory per element because of the extra references (previous and next pointers) that each node stores.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **`ArrayList`**: Best for scenarios where random access to elements is needed frequently.
  - **`LinkedList`**: Best for scenarios where elements are frequently added or removed from the beginning or middle of the list.

### 196. **What is the difference between a `Set` and a `Map` in Java?**

- **`Set`**:
  - A `Set` is a collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicate elements.
  - Examples of `Set` implementations include `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, and `TreeSet`.
  - A `Set` does not store key-value pairs; it only stores individual elements.
  
- **`Map`**:
  - A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is associated with a single value.
  - Examples of `Map` implementations include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `Hashtable`.
  - A `Map` allows you to store data in a way that can be retrieved by a specific key (i.e., you can get the value using the key).
  
**Key Differences**:
- A `Set` is a collection of elements, while a `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs.
- A `Set` only allows elements (no duplicates), while a `Map` stores values based on unique keys.

### 197. **What is the use of a `Dictionary` class?**

The `Dictionary` class in Java is part of the original version of the Java Collections Framework, but it has been **deprecated** as of Java 1.2 in favor of the `Map` interface. It was intended to represent a key-value pair mapping, similar to `Map`, but with a less efficient and limited implementation.

- **Purpose**: It was originally used to store a set of key-value pairs, where the keys and values could be any objects.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `get(Object key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the given key.
  - `put(Object key, Object value)`: Adds a key-value pair to the dictionary.
  - `remove(Object key)`: Removes the key-value pair for the given key.

However, since `Dictionary` is now considered outdated, it is recommended to use `HashMap` or `Hashtable` instead.

### 198. **What is the default size of load factor in a `HashMap` collection in Java?**

The default **load factor** in a `HashMap` is **0.75**.

- **Load Factor**: The load factor determines when to resize the `HashMap`. When the number of elements exceeds the product of the current capacity and load factor, the `HashMap` is resized (usually doubled).
  
  - Formula: `threshold = capacity * load factor`

- **Default Capacity**: The default initial capacity of a `HashMap` is **16**.
  
So, with the default load factor of 0.75 and an initial capacity of 16, the `HashMap` will resize when the number of elements exceeds 12 (16 * 0.75 = 12).

### 199. **What is the significance of load factor in a `HashMap` in Java?**

The **load factor** in a `HashMap` is a measure of how full the `HashMap` can get before it needs to be resized (i.e., when the capacity is exceeded).

- **Low Load Factor (e.g., 0.5)**: 
  - The `HashMap` will resize more often, but this may result in fewer collisions and faster lookups.
  - It uses more memory since it allocates more space than required for fewer entries.

- **High Load Factor (e.g., 0.9)**: 
  - The `HashMap` will resize less often, using less memory but potentially increasing the likelihood of collisions, which can degrade the performance of lookups, insertions, and deletions.

- **Default Load Factor (0.75)**: 
  - This is a good compromise between time and space complexity for most use cases. It balances memory usage and performance.

### 200. **What are the major differences between a `HashSet` and a `HashMap`?**

The main differences between a `HashSet` and a `HashMap` in Java are as follows:

| Feature            | `HashSet`                                      | `HashMap`                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | A `HashSet` is a collection that stores unique elements. | A `HashMap` is a collection that stores key-value pairs (unique keys with values). |
| **Storage Type**   | Only stores **elements** (objects) without any key-value association. | Stores **key-value pairs**, where each key is unique, and it is mapped to a specific value. |
| **Implementation** | Implements `Set` interface.                    | Implements `Map` interface.                   |
| **Duplicates**     | Does not allow duplicates.                    | Does not allow duplicate keys, but allows duplicate values. |
| **Null values**    | Allows only **one null element**.             | Allows **one null key** and multiple null values. |
| **Usage**          | Useful when you need to store unique items without any association. | Useful when you need to store pairs of data (key-value pairs). |
| **Methods**        | Inherits methods from `Set` interface.        | Inherits methods from `Map` interface. |
| **Ordering**       | No ordering guarantees.                       | `HashMap` also does not guarantee order, but `LinkedHashMap` maintains insertion order. |

### 201. **What are the similarities between a `HashSet` and a `HashMap` in Java?**

Despite their differences, `HashSet` and `HashMap` have several similarities:

- **Underlying Data Structure**: Both `HashSet` and `HashMap` are backed by a hash table, which uses the hash code of the elements or keys to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **No Duplicate Keys**: 
  - A `HashSet` does not allow duplicate elements, and a `HashMap` does not allow duplicate keys (though values can be duplicated).
- **Non-Synchronized**: Both `HashSet` and `HashMap` are not synchronized by default.
- **Performance**: Both provide constant-time complexity O(1) for basic operations like `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, and `get()` (in the case of `HashMap`, for key-based retrieval).
- **Null Elements**: Both allow **null** values. `HashSet` can store a single `null` element, and `HashMap` allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.

### 202. **What is the reason for overriding `equals()` method?**

In Java, the `equals()` method is overridden to ensure that objects are compared based on their **logical content** rather than their memory address or reference. By default, the `equals()` method in the `Object` class compares memory references (i.e., two objects are considered equal only if they refer to the exact same memory location). 

Overriding the `equals()` method allows you to define the equality criteria for your custom objects. For example, in a `Person` class, you might want two `Person` objects to be considered equal if they have the same name and age, rather than comparing their memory references.

Key reasons to override `equals()`:
- **Define custom equality criteria** for objects based on attributes.
- Ensure objects work properly in collections like `HashSet`, `HashMap`, or `LinkedHashSet` where the concept of equality is used to avoid duplicates or to correctly map keys.

When overriding `equals()`, it is also recommended to override the `hashCode()` method to maintain consistency between the two methods. If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, they must also have the same hash code.

### 203. **How can we synchronize the elements of a `List`, a `Set`, or a `Map`?**

To synchronize collections like `List`, `Set`, or `Map` in Java, you can use one of the following approaches:

1. **Using `Collections.synchronizedList()`, `synchronizedSet()`, or `synchronizedMap()`**:
   The `Collections` class provides static methods to return a synchronized version of the given collection.

   - **For List**: 
     ```java
     List<String> list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
     ```
   - **For Set**:
     ```java
     Set<String> set = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
     ```
   - **For Map**:
     ```java
     Map<String, String> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
     ```

   These methods wrap the original collection and provide synchronized access to it. All methods on the returned collection are synchronized, so only one thread can access a method at a time.

2. **Using `Concurrent Collections`**:
   For more advanced thread-safety features, you can use the `java.util.concurrent` package, which provides thread-safe versions of common collections:
   - **For List**: `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
   - **For Set**: `CopyOnWriteArraySet`
   - **For Map**: `ConcurrentHashMap`

   These collections are designed to allow concurrent access, with different synchronization mechanisms that improve performance in multithreaded scenarios.

3. **Using `synchronized` keyword**:
   If you have a custom collection or want to synchronize a block of code manually, you can use the `synchronized` keyword.
   For example:
   ```java
   synchronized(list) {
       // Perform operations on the list
   }
   ```
   This ensures that only one thread can access the block of code that manipulates the collection at a time.

By using these methods, you can ensure thread-safety when accessing or modifying collections in a multithreaded environment.

### 204. **What is Hash Collision? How Java handles hash-collision in `HashMap`?**

**Hash Collision** occurs when two different keys in a hash-based collection, such as `HashMap`, generate the same hash code. This is problematic because the hash code is used to determine the bucket where the entry (key-value pair) is stored. If two different keys have the same hash code, the `HashMap` will have to manage this collision to store and retrieve the entries correctly.

**How Java handles hash-collision in `HashMap`**:
- Java's `HashMap` uses **chaining** to handle hash collisions. If two keys have the same hash code, the `HashMap` stores both key-value pairs in the same bucket, but in a linked list (or in newer versions of Java, a balanced tree structure if there are many collisions).
- When a collision occurs, Java checks the entries in that bucket and compares the keys using the `equals()` method. If the keys are equal, the value associated with the key is updated, otherwise, a new entry is added to the linked list (or tree structure).
  
   **Key Points:**
   - Chaining (linked list or tree structure) is used when hash collisions occur.
   - **equals()** method is used to differentiate between keys with the same hash code.

### 205. **What are the Hash Collision resolution techniques?**

There are several techniques to resolve hash collisions in hash-based data structures like `HashMap`:

1. **Chaining (Separate Chaining)**:
   - This technique involves storing multiple elements that hash to the same index in a separate data structure, such as a linked list or a tree.
   - In the case of a collision, the new element is simply added to the linked list (or tree) at the same hash index.

2. **Open Addressing**:
   - In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available position in the hash table.
   - There are several strategies to probe for the next available position:
     - **Linear Probing**: Check the next slot in the array (i.e., index + 1, index + 2, etc.).
     - **Quadratic Probing**: Use a quadratic function to find the next available slot.
     - **Double Hashing**: Apply a second hash function to calculate the next index.

3. **Rehashing**:
   - Rehashing involves increasing the size of the hash table and recalculating the hash codes for all the existing keys in the new, larger table.
   - This technique helps reduce collisions by distributing the keys more evenly.

### 206. **What is the difference between `Queue` and `Stack` data structures?**

Both `Queue` and `Stack` are linear data structures used to store collections of elements, but they differ in how they manage the order in which elements are added and removed:

| Feature         | **Queue**                                         | **Stack**                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Order**       | Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** order.      | Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.       |
| **Basic Operations** | `enqueue()` (add an element to the queue) | `push()` (add an element to the stack)             |
|                 | `dequeue()` (remove an element from the queue)    | `pop()` (remove an element from the stack)         |
| **Use Cases**   | Used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved, such as scheduling tasks, handling requests, or processing jobs. | Used in scenarios where last-added elements need to be processed first, such as undo functionality, function calls, or expression evaluation. |
| **Implementation** | Can be implemented using an array or a linked list. | Typically implemented using an array or a linked list. |

### 207. **What is an Iterator in Java?**

An **Iterator** in Java is an interface used to iterate over the elements of a collection, such as `List`, `Set`, or `Queue`. It provides a way to traverse through the collection and remove elements during iteration.

The `Iterator` interface provides three main methods:
1. **`hasNext()`**: Returns `true` if there are more elements to iterate over; otherwise, it returns `false`.
2. **`next()`**: Returns the next element in the iteration and advances the iterator.
3. **`remove()`**: Removes the last element returned by the iterator (optional operation).

**Example:**
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");
list.add("Cherry");

Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    String element = iterator.next();
    System.out.println(element);
}
```

**Key Points:**
- An `Iterator` can only move forward, and it does not allow random access to the elements.
- It provides a safe way to traverse and modify collections while iterating (using the `remove()` method).
- All collection classes in Java (that implement the `Collection` interface) provide an iterator, which can be accessed via the `iterator()` method.

### 208. **What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration in Java?**

`Iterator` and `Enumeration` are both interfaces in Java used for iterating over collections, but they differ in several key aspects:

| Feature             | **Iterator**                              | **Enumeration**                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Package**         | `java.util`                               | `java.util`                              |
| **Methods**         | `hasNext()`, `next()`, `remove()`         | `hasMoreElements()`, `nextElement()`     |
| **Removal**         | Supports removal of elements during iteration using `remove()` method. | Does not support removal of elements.    |
| **Added in**        | Introduced in Java 1.2 (Java Collections Framework). | Introduced in Java 1.0.                  |
| **Purpose**         | More powerful and flexible than `Enumeration`. | Older, less flexible interface used in legacy classes like `Vector`. |
| **Use Cases**       | Preferred for newer collections like `List`, `Set`. | Typically used for older classes like `Vector`, `Stack`. |

**Example:**
- `Iterator` is preferred in modern Java as it allows both iteration and element removal during the iteration process.
- `Enumeration` is considered obsolete and is mostly used for legacy code or older collection classes.

### 209. **What is the design pattern used in the implementation of Enumeration in Java?**

The design pattern used in the implementation of `Enumeration` is the **Iterator Design Pattern**. This pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying implementation of the collection. 

- **Iterator Pattern** allows a collection to be traversed without exposing its internal structure. In Java, `Enumeration` was an early form of the Iterator pattern.
- The pattern involves:
  - A **collection** to store elements.
  - A **concrete iterator** to traverse through the collection.
  - The collection and iterator are separated, which promotes flexibility and loose coupling.

### 210. **Which methods do we need to override to use an object as a key in a HashMap?**

To use an object as a key in a `HashMap`, you need to override the following two methods from the `Object` class:

1. **`hashCode()`**:
   - This method provides a hash code that is used to store and retrieve objects in hash-based collections (like `HashMap`).
   - It ensures that objects with the same content return the same hash code, which helps in quick lookup.

2. **`equals()`**:
   - This method is used to compare two objects for equality.
   - The `HashMap` uses `equals()` to compare keys to see if they are the same. If two objects are considered equal (according to `equals()`), they should have the same `hashCode()` value.

**Example**:
```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Override hashCode() and equals()
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
    }
}
```

### 211. **How will you reverse a List in Java?**

You can reverse a `List` in Java using the `Collections.reverse()` method from the `java.util.Collections` utility class.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReverseList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"));
        
        // Reverse the list
        Collections.reverse(list);
        
        // Print the reversed list
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

This will output:
```
[Cherry, Banana, Apple]
```

### 212. **How will you convert an array of String objects into a List?**

You can convert an array of `String` objects into a `List` using `Arrays.asList()` method.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayToList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] array = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};
        
        // Convert array to list
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);
        
        // Print the list
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

This will output:
```
[Apple, Banana, Cherry]
```

**Note**: The list returned by `Arrays.asList()` is a fixed-size list. You cannot add or remove elements from it, but you can modify existing elements. To create a resizable list, you can use a `new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array))`.

### 213. **What is the difference between `peek()`, `poll()`, and `remove()` methods of `Queue` interface in Java?**

The `Queue` interface in Java provides methods to work with the elements in a queue-like data structure. The `peek()`, `poll()`, and `remove()` methods are used to retrieve or remove elements from the queue. Here is a breakdown of their differences:

| Method        | Description                                                                                   | Behavior when the Queue is empty                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **`peek()`**   | Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.                             | Returns `null` if the queue is empty (for some implementations, like `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`). |
| **`poll()`**   | Retrieves and removes the element at the front of the queue.                                  | Returns `null` if the queue is empty.                      |
| **`remove()`** | Retrieves and removes the element at the front of the queue.                                  | Throws `NoSuchElementException` if the queue is empty.     |

**Key differences**:
- `peek()` does not remove the element, while `poll()` and `remove()` do.
- `poll()` returns `null` if the queue is empty, while `remove()` throws an exception.

**Example**:
```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.offer(10);
queue.offer(20);

System.out.println(queue.peek());   // Output: 10
System.out.println(queue.poll());   // Output: 10
System.out.println(queue.remove()); // Output: 20
```

### 214. **What is the difference between Array and ArrayList in Java?**

Both arrays and `ArrayList` are used to store collections of data, but they differ in several important ways:

| Feature                    | **Array**                                  | **ArrayList**                             |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Size**                   | Fixed size. Once declared, the size cannot change. | Dynamic size. It can grow or shrink automatically. |
| **Type**                   | Can store elements of any type (primitive or objects). | Only stores objects (autoboxing allows primitives to be converted to corresponding wrapper classes). |
| **Memory Allocation**      | Memory is allocated for all elements upfront. | Memory is allocated dynamically as elements are added. |
| **Performance**            | Faster access to elements due to direct indexing. | Slightly slower due to the need for resizing and using generics. |
| **Flexibility**            | Fixed size, cannot add/remove elements after creation. | Supports adding, removing, and resizing dynamically. |
| **Syntax**                 | Simple syntax: `int[] arr = new int[5];` | Uses `ArrayList<T>`: `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();` |
| **Methods**                | Limited methods: `length` property.        | Rich set of methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `size()`, etc. |

**Example**:
- **Array**: 
  ```java
  int[] arr = new int[5];
  arr[0] = 10;
  ```
- **ArrayList**:
  ```java
  ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
  list.add(10);
  ```

### 215. **How will you insert, delete, and retrieve elements from a HashMap collection in Java?**

In Java, `HashMap` is a collection that stores key-value pairs. You can insert, delete, and retrieve elements using the following methods:

1. **Insert (Put key-value pair)**:
   To insert a key-value pair into the `HashMap`, use the `put()` method.

   ```java
   HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   map.put("Apple", 10);  // Inserts "Apple" as the key and 10 as the value
   ```

2. **Delete (Remove key-value pair)**:
   To remove a key-value pair from the `HashMap`, use the `remove()` method with the key.

   ```java
   map.remove("Apple");  // Removes the key-value pair associated with "Apple"
   ```

3. **Retrieve (Get value by key)**:
   To retrieve the value associated with a key, use the `get()` method.

   ```java
   Integer value = map.get("Apple");  // Retrieves the value (10) associated with "Apple"
   ```

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Insert
        map.put("Apple", 10);
        map.put("Banana", 20);
        
        // Retrieve
        System.out.println("Apple: " + map.get("Apple"));  // Output: Apple: 10
        
        // Delete
        map.remove("Banana");
        
        System.out.println("Banana removed: " + map.containsKey("Banana"));  // Output: Banana removed: false
    }
}
```

### 216. **What are the main differences between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap in Java?**

Both `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are used for storing key-value pairs, but they are designed for different use cases, especially in multi-threaded environments.

| Feature                     | **HashMap**                                 | **ConcurrentHashMap**                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Thread-safety**           | Not thread-safe. Multiple threads accessing it concurrently can lead to data corruption. | Thread-safe. It allows concurrent access by multiple threads without corrupting data. |
| **Synchronization**         | Not synchronized. If used in multiple threads, it requires external synchronization. | Internal synchronization using segments, allowing better concurrency. |
| **Performance**             | Generally faster for single-threaded use because it doesn't have synchronization overhead. | Slower than `HashMap` in single-threaded scenarios, but performs well in multi-threaded environments. |
| **Null Keys/Values**        | Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values. | Does not allow `null` keys or `null` values. |
| **Use Case**                | Suitable for single-threaded applications or when synchronized externally. | Suitable for multi-threaded environments, where multiple threads concurrently access the map. |
| **Iteration**               | Iterators are not fail-safe and can throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration. | Iterators are fail-safe and do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. |

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        
        // Insert
        map.put("Apple", 10);
        map.put("Banana", 20);
        
        // Retrieve
        System.out.println("Apple: " + map.get("Apple"));
        
        // Delete
        map.remove("Banana");
    }
}
```

In a multi-threaded environment, `ConcurrentHashMap` provides better thread safety compared to `HashMap`.

### 217. **What is the increasing order of performance for the following collection classes in Java?**

To answer this question, we need to consider the performance of different collection classes based on common operations like insertion, retrieval, deletion, and iteration. The performance can be divided as follows (in terms of common operations):

1. **ArrayList**: 
   - **Insertion at end**: O(1) (amortized)
   - **Insertion at random position**: O(n)
   - **Accessing by index**: O(1)
   - **Deletion**: O(n) (for deleting from middle or random position)
   
2. **LinkedList**:
   - **Insertion at start/end**: O(1)
   - **Insertion at random position**: O(n) (because of traversal)
   - **Accessing by index**: O(n) (due to traversal)
   - **Deletion**: O(1) if node reference is known, O(n) for other cases

3. **HashSet**:
   - **Insertion**: O(1) (amortized)
   - **Deletion**: O(1)
   - **Accessing**: O(1) for checking if an element exists
   - **Iteration**: O(n)

4. **TreeSet**:
   - **Insertion**: O(log n)
   - **Deletion**: O(log n)
   - **Accessing**: O(log n) (for sorted access)
   - **Iteration**: O(n)

5. **HashMap**:
   - **Insertion**: O(1) (amortized)
   - **Deletion**: O(1)
   - **Accessing by key**: O(1)
   - **Iteration**: O(n)

6. **TreeMap**:
   - **Insertion**: O(log n)
   - **Deletion**: O(log n)
   - **Accessing by key**: O(log n)
   - **Iteration**: O(n)

**Increasing order of performance** (based on general operations like insertion, deletion, and access):
- **LinkedList** < **ArrayList** < **TreeMap/TreeSet** < **HashSet/HashMap**

**Explanation**: 
- `ArrayList` is generally faster for random access, but slower for insertions and deletions that are not at the end.
- `LinkedList` performs well with insertions and deletions at the beginning or end but suffers from poor random access.
- `HashSet` and `HashMap` offer constant-time operations for insertion, deletion, and access (average case).
- `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` offer log-time performance for most operations due to the underlying red-black tree.

### 218. **Why does the Map interface not extend the Collection interface in Java?**

The `Map` interface does not extend the `Collection` interface because `Map` is designed to store key-value pairs, while `Collection` is designed to store a single set of objects. The `Collection` interface represents collections of elements that do not have a key-value structure. 

- **Map**: Holds pairs of objects, where each pair consists of a **key** and a **value**. A `Map` can have unique keys, but values can be duplicated.
- **Collection**: A `Collection` holds individual elements without any associated keys.

If `Map` extended `Collection`, it would imply that a `Map` is a collection of values, which is not true. The key-value structure of `Map` is distinct from the basic collection concepts represented by `Collection` and its subinterfaces like `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`.

### 219. **What are the different ways to iterate elements of a list in Java?**

There are several ways to iterate over elements of a `List` in Java:

1. **Using a for-each loop**:
   - The simplest way to iterate over a list.
   ```java
   List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   for (Integer item : list) {
       System.out.println(item);
   }
   ```

2. **Using a for loop with index**:
   - Useful if you need to access the elements by index.
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
       System.out.println(list.get(i));
   }
   ```

3. **Using an Iterator**:
   - Iterator provides a way to traverse through the list and allows removing elements during iteration.
   ```java
   Iterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator();
   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
       System.out.println(iterator.next());
   }
   ```

4. **Using a ListIterator**:
   - A `ListIterator` can be used to traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.
   ```java
   ListIterator<Integer> listIterator = list.listIterator();
   while (listIterator.hasNext()) {
       System.out.println(listIterator.next());
   }
   ```

5. **Using Java 8 Stream API**:
   - Java 8 introduced Streams, allowing more functional programming styles for iteration.
   ```java
   list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
   ```

6. **Using the `forEach` method (Java 8)**:
   - You can use the `forEach()` method available in the `List` interface (Java 8 and above).
   ```java
   list.forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

### 220. **What is `CopyOnWriteArrayList`? How is it different from `ArrayList` in Java?**

`CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` in the Java Collections framework. It is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and is designed to handle concurrent modifications more efficiently.

#### Key differences between `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `ArrayList`:

| Feature                        | **ArrayList**                                | **CopyOnWriteArrayList**                        |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety**               | Not thread-safe. Requires external synchronization for concurrent access. | Thread-safe. Modifications are safely handled with internal synchronization. |
| **Modification Behavior**       | Allows concurrent read and write, but not safely without synchronization. | Modifications (add/remove) result in copying the entire array, so no locks are needed for reading. |
| **Performance**                 | Faster for single-threaded access or when modifications are infrequent. | Slower for writes due to array copying, but performs well for frequent reads. |
| **Use Case**                    | Suitable for single-threaded or synchronized environments. | Suitable for environments with more reads than writes and where thread-safety is needed. |
| **Read/Write Consistency**      | Reads and writes can be inconsistent if accessed by multiple threads. | Reads always reflect the most recent consistent state, even during writes. |

#### Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class CopyOnWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CopyOnWriteArrayList<Integer> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        list.add(1);
        list.add(2);

        // Concurrent modification
        list.add(3);

        // Iterating without issues during modification
        for (Integer item : list) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}
```

### Key points:
- **CopyOnWriteArrayList**: Ideal for situations with many reads and few writes, because it ensures that the list remains thread-safe even while iterating or making modifications. However, it can incur additional overhead when performing write operations since it creates a copy of the array each time a modification is made.
- **ArrayList**: Not thread-safe, and if multiple threads modify it concurrently, it requires external synchronization. However, it performs better in single-threaded scenarios.

### 221. **How is `remove()` method implemented in a `HashMap`?**

The `remove()` method in a `HashMap` is used to remove a key-value pair from the map. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Hashing**: The `HashMap` computes the hash code of the provided key to determine the appropriate bucket where the key-value pair resides.
2. **Bucket Search**: Once the correct bucket is identified, the method searches through the bucket (which is a linked list or a tree, depending on the implementation) to find the corresponding key-value pair.
3. **Key Comparison**: The method compares the key with the stored keys using `equals()` method to ensure that the correct entry is removed.
4. **Removal**: Once the correct key-value pair is found, it is removed from the list (or tree) inside the bucket. If the bucket is empty after removal, the bucket reference is set to `null`.
5. **Rehashing**: If necessary, the `HashMap` may perform rehashing (resizing the underlying array) to maintain performance when the number of elements becomes too large.

Here's a simple example:

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("one", 1);
map.put("two", 2);
map.remove("one");  // Removes the key-value pair ("one", 1)
```

### 222. **What is `BlockingQueue` in Java Collections?**

`BlockingQueue` is an interface in the `java.util.concurrent` package that represents a thread-safe collection designed to be used in concurrent programming. It supports operations that block the calling thread, either when the queue is full (in the case of insertion) or empty (in the case of retrieval). It provides thread-safe methods for adding and removing elements, which can be particularly useful in producer-consumer problems.

Key features of `BlockingQueue`:
- **Blocking Operations**: Methods like `put()` and `take()` block the calling thread until they are safe to proceed.
- **Bounded Capacity**: Many implementations of `BlockingQueue` allow you to set a limit on the number of elements that can be in the queue at a time.
- **Thread-Safe**: It provides thread safety out of the box, making it suitable for multithreaded environments.

Popular implementations of `BlockingQueue`:
- `ArrayBlockingQueue`
- `LinkedBlockingQueue`
- `PriorityBlockingQueue`

Example usage:

```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);

// Producer thread
new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        queue.put(1); // Adds element to the queue
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}).start();

// Consumer thread
new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        Integer value = queue.take(); // Takes an element from the queue
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}).start();
```

### 223. **How is `TreeMap` class implemented in Java?**

`TreeMap` is a class in the `java.util` package that implements the `Map` interface and stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on the natural ordering of its keys or by a comparator provided at map creation. Internally, `TreeMap` is implemented using a **Red-Black Tree**, which is a balanced binary search tree.

Key features of `TreeMap`:
- **Sorted Order**: Keys are maintained in a sorted order, either by the natural order of the keys (`Comparable`) or by a custom comparator (`Comparator`).
- **Logarithmic Time Complexity**: Operations like `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, and `containsKey()` are O(log n) due to the Red-Black Tree structure.
- **No `null` keys**: Unlike `HashMap`, `TreeMap` does not allow `null` as a key because `null` cannot be compared with other objects.

Example usage:

```java
TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(1, "One");
map.put(2, "Two");
map.put(3, "Three");

// Iteration in sorted order of keys
for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
}
```

### 224. **What is the difference between Fail-fast and Fail-safe iterator in Java?**

In Java, **iterators** are classified into two types based on how they behave in the presence of concurrent modifications:

1. **Fail-fast Iterator**:
   - A **Fail-fast iterator** immediately throws a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified after the iterator is created (except by the iterator itself).
   - This behavior is seen in collections like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.
   - It is intended to detect concurrent modifications that might lead to unpredictable behavior.
   - **Example**: 
     ```java
     List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
     list.add("One");
     Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
     list.add("Two"); // Concurrent modification
     it.next(); // Throws ConcurrentModificationException
     ```

2. **Fail-safe Iterator**:
   - A **Fail-safe iterator** does not throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` when the collection is modified during iteration.
   - It operates on a copy of the collection and allows modifications to the original collection without affecting the iteration.
   - Fail-safe iterators are typically used in classes like `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, and other concurrent collections.
   - **Example**: 
     ```java
     List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
     list.add("One");
     Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
     list.add("Two"); // No exception thrown
     it.next(); // Continues without exception
     ```

### 225. **How does `ConcurrentHashMap` work in Java?**

`ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe implementation of the `Map` interface, which is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package. It allows for concurrent read and write operations by dividing the map into **segments**, each of which can be locked independently. This reduces contention between threads and increases the overall performance of the map in multi-threaded environments.

Key features of `ConcurrentHashMap`:
- **Segmented Locking**: It uses a technique called **segmented locking** (based on internal buckets) to allow multiple threads to update different parts of the map concurrently without affecting other threads' access to other parts.
- **Thread-Safe Reads and Writes**: Reads are thread-safe without requiring any locks, and write operations only lock the affected segment of the map.
- **No Blocking**: Unlike `Hashtable`, which blocks the entire table on each write, `ConcurrentHashMap` allows concurrent reads and writes (except when modifying the same segment).
- **Scalable**: It allows scaling across multiple CPUs and reduces contention.

Example usage:

```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("One", 1);
map.put("Two", 2);

// Multiple threads can safely update different keys simultaneously
map.put("Three", 3);
map.put("Four", 4);

// Read operation
System.out.println(map.get("One")); // 1
```

Key differences from `HashMap`:
- **Thread-Safety**: `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed for concurrent access, whereas `HashMap` is not thread-safe.
- **Locking**: `ConcurrentHashMap` uses a finer-grained locking mechanism compared to `Hashtable`'s single lock for the entire map.


### 226. **What is the importance of `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods?**

The `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods are crucial for ensuring the correct behavior of hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`. They serve the following purposes:

1. **`hashCode()` Method**: 
   - It provides a **unique integer value** (hash code) for each object, which is used for quickly locating the object in hash-based collections. 
   - When you put an object into a `HashMap` or a `HashSet`, the `hashCode()` value is used to determine where the object will be stored in the underlying data structure.
   
2. **`equals()` Method**:
   - It is used to **compare objects for equality**. When two objects have the same hash code, the `equals()` method is used to check if they are truly equal.
   - In collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`, objects that have the same hash code but are not equal need to be differentiated by the `equals()` method to ensure no collisions.

**Example**:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }
}
```

### 227. **What is the contract of `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods in Java?**

The contract for the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods in Java is specified in the `Object` class and is as follows:

1. **`equals()` method contract**:
   - **Reflexive**: For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(x)` must return `true`.
   - **Symmetric**: For any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, if `x.equals(y)` is `true`, then `y.equals(x)` must also be `true`.
   - **Transitive**: For any non-null reference values `x`, `y`, and `z`, if `x.equals(y)` is `true` and `y.equals(z)` is `true`, then `x.equals(z)` must also be `true`.
   - **Consistent**: For any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` must consistently return the same result, provided no information used in the comparison is modified.
   - **Null comparison**: For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(null)` must return `false`.

2. **`hashCode()` method contract**:
   - **Consistent**: If two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they must have the same hash code.
   - **Unequal objects**: If two objects are not equal according to `equals()`, they can have the same or different hash codes. However, it's generally better to return different hash codes to reduce collisions.
   - **Non-changing**: The hash code of an object must remain the same during its lifetime unless its fields, which are involved in the `equals()` comparison, are modified.

### 228. **What is an `EnumSet` in Java?**

An `EnumSet` is a specialized `Set` implementation in the `java.util` package designed to work specifically with **enums**. It is part of the `java.util` collection framework and provides an efficient way to work with sets of enum values.

**Key Features**:
- **Type-Safe**: `EnumSet` can only contain enum constants and not other objects, ensuring type safety.
- **Performance**: It is more efficient than using `HashSet` for enums since it is implemented using bit vectors.
- **No Null Values**: `EnumSet` does not allow `null` values, unlike `HashSet`.

**Example**:
```java
enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }

EnumSet<Day> weekend = EnumSet.of(Day.SATURDAY, Day.SUNDAY);
EnumSet<Day> weekdays = EnumSet.range(Day.MONDAY, Day.FRIDAY);
```

### 229. **What are the main Concurrent Collection classes in Java?**

Java provides several concurrent collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package, which are designed to be thread-safe and to handle concurrent access in multithreaded environments:

1. **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: A thread-safe map that allows concurrent read and write operations without locking the entire map. It supports segmented locking for better performance.
2. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**: A thread-safe list where modifications (like add, remove) create a new copy of the array, allowing for safe iteration without external synchronization.
3. **`CopyOnWriteArraySet`**: Similar to `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, but implements the `Set` interface. It ensures thread-safety by creating a new copy of the underlying array on modification.
4. **`BlockingQueue`**: An interface for thread-safe queues that support blocking operations when the queue is full (e.g., `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`).
5. **`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`**: A non-blocking thread-safe queue for concurrent access.
6. **`ConcurrentSkipListMap` and `ConcurrentSkipListSet`**: These are sorted thread-safe collections implemented using skip lists.

### 230. **How will you convert a Collection to `SynchronizedCollection` in Java?**

To convert a `Collection` to a synchronized version in Java, you can use the `Collections.synchronizedCollection()` method, which wraps the given collection in a synchronized collection.

**Example**:
```java
Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("one");
list.add("two");
list.add("three");

Collection<String> syncList = Collections.synchronizedCollection(list);
```

The synchronized collection ensures that all operations on the collection are thread-safe. However, you still need to manually synchronize blocks if you are iterating over the collection, like this:

```java
synchronized (syncList) {
    Iterator<String> iterator = syncList.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(iterator.next());
    }
}
```

### 231. **How is `IdentityHashMap` different from a regular `Map` in Java?**

`IdentityHashMap` is a special implementation of the `Map` interface that differs from regular maps (like `HashMap`) in how it compares keys. 

- **Key Comparison**: 
  - In a regular `HashMap`, keys are compared based on their `equals()` method. If two keys are considered equal according to the `equals()` method, they are treated as the same key, regardless of their memory references.
  - In an `IdentityHashMap`, keys are compared based on their **reference equality** (`==`), meaning two keys are considered equal only if they refer to the exact same object in memory. Even if two keys have the same content but are different objects, they are treated as different keys.

**Example**:
```java
String a = new String("hello");
String b = new String("hello");

Map<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
hashMap.put(a, "value");
System.out.println(hashMap.containsKey(b)); // true, because a.equals(b) is true

Map<String, String> identityMap = new IdentityHashMap<>();
identityMap.put(a, "value");
System.out.println(identityMap.containsKey(b)); // false, because a != b (different objects)
```

### 232. **What is the main use of `IdentityHashMap`?**

The main use of `IdentityHashMap` is when you need to distinguish objects based on **reference equality** rather than logical equality (i.e., based on the `equals()` method). This is useful in scenarios such as:

1. **Identity-based mapping**: When the distinction between two objects with the same content but different references matters, such as tracking objects by their identity rather than their content.
2. **Memory-sensitive operations**: When you want to track object references and make decisions based on whether two variables point to the same object in memory.

Common use cases include:
- **Object identity comparison**: Where you need to ensure that only the same object (by reference) is used as a key, not just objects that are logically equal.
- **Garbage collection monitoring**: If you're tracking objects for cleanup and need to differentiate between different references to the same object.

### 233. **How can we improve the performance of `IdentityHashMap`?**

To improve the performance of an `IdentityHashMap`, you can focus on the following strategies:

1. **Initial Capacity**: Like other map implementations, `IdentityHashMap` can be initialized with a custom initial capacity to reduce the need for rehashing. This is especially important if you expect to have a large number of entries.
   ```java
   Map<String, String> map = new IdentityHashMap<>(1000);  // set a higher initial capacity
   ```

2. **Load Factor**: The default load factor for `IdentityHashMap` is 0.75, which is generally good for balancing space and time complexity. However, if you expect fewer collisions and can tolerate higher space consumption, you may increase the load factor to improve performance during insertions.
   ```java
   Map<String, String> map = new IdentityHashMap<>(1000, 0.9f);  // a higher load factor
   ```

3. **Pre-allocate and use `IdentityHashMap` in scenarios where reference equality is required**: Using `IdentityHashMap` only when reference equality is essential ensures that you avoid unnecessary overhead, as regular maps (like `HashMap`) will perform better when you don't require reference-based comparison.

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Object Creation**: Since `IdentityHashMap` is sensitive to reference equality, avoid creating unnecessary object copies as keys when you don't need them to behave as distinct entities.

### 234. **Is `IdentityHashMap` thread-safe?**

No, `IdentityHashMap` is **not thread-safe** by default. Just like other regular `Map` implementations such as `HashMap`, it does not provide synchronization for concurrent access. If multiple threads access an `IdentityHashMap` concurrently, you need to manually synchronize access to it using `synchronized` blocks or other concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., using `Collections.synchronizedMap()` or `ConcurrentHashMap`).

**Example** of synchronizing access:
```java
Map<String, String> map = new IdentityHashMap<>();
Map<String, String> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(map);

// Now access `syncMap` safely across multiple threads
```

If you need thread-safety for an `IdentityHashMap`, you can either use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` as shown above or explicitly handle synchronization yourself.

### 235. **What is a `WeakHashMap` in Java?**

A `WeakHashMap` is a type of `Map` in Java where the keys are **weakly referenced**. This means that if a key in a `WeakHashMap` is no longer referenced by any other part of the program (i.e., it becomes eligible for garbage collection), the corresponding entry in the map is automatically removed.

- **Key feature**: The entries in a `WeakHashMap` are not guaranteed to be present as long as their keys are alive. When the garbage collector clears a weakly referenced key, the corresponding entry is removed from the map.
  
- **Use cases**: A `WeakHashMap` is useful in scenarios where you want the map to automatically clean up entries once the keys are no longer in use elsewhere, which helps avoid memory leaks.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class WeakHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> map = new WeakHashMap<>();
        
        // Creating a weak reference to the key
        String key = new String("key");
        map.put(key, "value");

        // The map entry is removed when 'key' is garbage collected
        key = null;  // Now the "key" is eligible for GC

        System.gc();  // Explicitly suggest garbage collection

        System.out.println(map);  // The map will be empty, as the key is garbage collected
    }
}
```

### 236. **How can you make a Collection class read-only in Java?**

In Java, you can make a `Collection` (or any other `List`, `Set`, or `Map`) read-only by using the `Collections.unmodifiableCollection()` method. This method wraps a collection and prevents any modifications to it (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying elements).

- **Unmodifiable collections**: After you wrap a collection, any attempt to modify it will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReadOnlyCollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("apple");
        list.add("banana");

        List<String> unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);

        // The following line will throw an UnsupportedOperationException
        // unmodifiableList.add("cherry");

        System.out.println(unmodifiableList);  // Output: [apple, banana]
    }
}
```

### 237. **When is `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown in Java?**

The `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown in Java when an operation is not supported by the current implementation of a class or interface. Common situations where this exception is thrown include:

1. **Read-only collections**: If you attempt to modify a collection that is designed to be unmodifiable (e.g., using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`).
2. **Abstract methods**: When an abstract method is invoked on a class that hasn't implemented it (but this typically results in `AbstractMethodError` instead).
3. **Unsupported operations in certain classes**: For example, `remove()` operation on an immutable list or unsupported operations in custom collections.

**Example**:
```java
List<String> unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b")));
unmodifiableList.add("c");  // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
```

### 238. **Let’s say there is a `Customer` class. We add objects of `Customer` class to an `ArrayList`. How can we sort the `Customer` objects in `ArrayList` by using the customer `firstName` attribute of the `Customer` class?**

To sort a list of `Customer` objects based on the `firstName` attribute, you can use the `Comparator` interface. Here’s how you can implement it:

1. **Implement a `Comparator`** for sorting based on `firstName`.
2. **Use `Collections.sort()`** to sort the list using this comparator.

**Example**:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Customer {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;

    Customer(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Customer{firstName='" + firstName + "', lastName='" + lastName + "'}";
    }
}

public class SortCustomers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Customer> customers = new ArrayList<>();
        customers.add(new Customer("John", "Doe"));
        customers.add(new Customer("Alice", "Smith"));
        customers.add(new Customer("Bob", "Johnson"));

        // Sorting based on firstName using a comparator
        Collections.sort(customers, new Comparator<Customer>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Customer c1, Customer c2) {
                return c1.getFirstName().compareTo(c2.getFirstName());
            }
        });

        // Output sorted list
        System.out.println(customers);
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
[Customer{firstName='Alice', lastName='Smith'}, Customer{firstName='Bob', lastName='Johnson'}, Customer{firstName='John', lastName='Doe'}]
```

Alternatively, you can use a lambda expression to simplify the comparator:

```java
Collections.sort(customers, (c1, c2) -> c1.getFirstName().compareTo(c2.getFirstName()));
```

This code sorts the `ArrayList` of `Customer` objects by the `firstName` attribute in alphabetical order.

### 239. **What is the difference between Synchronized Collection and Concurrent Collection?**

The key difference between **Synchronized Collections** and **Concurrent Collections** lies in their thread-safety mechanism and performance:

1. **Synchronized Collection**:
   - In a synchronized collection, all the operations are synchronized using the `synchronized` keyword, meaning only one thread can access the collection at a time.
   - Synchronized collections often lock the entire collection during an operation (e.g., adding, removing, or accessing elements), which can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when there are many threads involved.
   - Examples of synchronized collections: `Collections.synchronizedList`, `Collections.synchronizedMap`.

2. **Concurrent Collection**:
   - Concurrent collections are specifically designed to allow safe access by multiple threads without locking the entire collection. They use sophisticated concurrency control mechanisms, such as fine-grained locking (e.g., locking only parts of the collection) or non-blocking algorithms.
   - These collections are typically more scalable and perform better in multithreaded environments than synchronized collections.
   - Examples of concurrent collections: `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`.

### 240. **What is the scenario to use `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java?**

You should use `ConcurrentHashMap` in scenarios where:
- You need **highly concurrent access** to a map in a multithreaded environment.
- You want **better performance** than `Hashtable` or a synchronized map because `ConcurrentHashMap` uses a more granular locking mechanism (locks individual segments instead of locking the entire map).
- There is a need to **avoid blocking** on common operations (e.g., `get()` and `put()`).
- It supports **thread-safe operations** with concurrency for updates (e.g., atomic operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `remove()`, `replace()`).

**Example usage**: 
- Storing session data or caching data where multiple threads need to read and update values concurrently.
- A shared, thread-safe, high-performance key-value store.

### 241. **How will you create an empty `Map` in Java?**

You can create an empty map using the following approaches:

1. Using the `HashMap` constructor:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   ```

2. Using `Collections.emptyMap()` (this creates an immutable empty map):
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = Collections.emptyMap();
   ```

3. Using `new TreeMap<>()` (if you need a `TreeMap`):
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
   ```

4. Using `LinkedHashMap` (if you need a `LinkedHashMap`):
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
   ```

### 242. **What is the difference between `remove()` method of Collection and `remove()` method of Iterator?**

1. **`remove()` method of Collection**:
   - It removes an element from the collection based on the **element itself**. You have to specify the object you want to remove.
   - Example: `list.remove("item")`
   - This method removes the first occurrence of the specified object from the collection.

2. **`remove()` method of Iterator**:
   - It removes the **last element returned** by the iterator. You cannot remove elements directly by providing an object reference (you must have iterated over it first).
   - Example: 
     ```java
     Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
     while (iterator.hasNext()) {
         String item = iterator.next();
         if (item.equals("item")) {
             iterator.remove(); // Removes "item" from the list
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Important**: This method is **safe** during iteration, whereas calling `remove()` on the collection directly while iterating can throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### 243. **Between an Array and `ArrayList`, which one is the preferred collection for storing objects?**

The preferred collection between an **Array** and an **`ArrayList`** depends on the use case:

1. **`Array`**:
   - **Fixed size**: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.
   - **Faster for random access**: Arrays are faster for accessing elements by index because they have a contiguous block of memory.
   - **Memory efficiency**: Arrays are more memory-efficient as they don’t have the overhead associated with `ArrayList` (like internal resizing).

   **Use case**: Arrays are preferred when the number of elements is fixed or when performance and memory efficiency are a priority.

2. **`ArrayList`**:
   - **Dynamic size**: `ArrayList` can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
   - **Convenient methods**: `ArrayList` provides built-in methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements. It’s more flexible than arrays in terms of functionality.
   - **Slower than arrays**: `ArrayList` is generally slower than arrays for random access due to its internal resizing mechanism and overhead.

   **Use case**: `ArrayList` is preferred when the size of the collection can vary during runtime, or when you need to frequently add or remove elements.

### Conclusion:
- Use **arrays** when you know the number of elements in advance and require high performance in terms of access speed and memory usage.
- Use **`ArrayList`** when you need a dynamic collection with easy-to-use methods for managing elements.

### 244. **Is it possible to replace `Hashtable` with `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java?**

Yes, it is possible to replace a `Hashtable` with a `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java, but there are important considerations:

- **Thread Safety**: Both `Hashtable` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are thread-safe, but they achieve it differently. `ConcurrentHashMap` offers better concurrency because it allows multiple threads to read and write concurrently in different segments of the map, whereas `Hashtable` synchronizes on the entire map, which can lead to contention.
  
- **Null Keys/Values**: `Hashtable` allows `null` keys and values, but `ConcurrentHashMap` **does not** allow `null` keys or values. This is an important difference when migrating from `Hashtable` to `ConcurrentHashMap`.

- **Performance**: `ConcurrentHashMap` generally provides better performance than `Hashtable` in highly concurrent applications due to finer-grained locking (i.e., segment-level locking). `Hashtable`, in comparison, locks the entire map for every operation, which can be a bottleneck in multi-threaded scenarios.

### 245. **How `CopyOnWriteArrayList` class is different from `ArrayList` and `Vector` classes?**

Here are the key differences between **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**, **`ArrayList`**, and **`Vector`**:

1. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**:
   - **Thread-safety**: It is thread-safe for **read operations**. Write operations (add, remove, set) create a copy of the underlying array, so modifications don't affect ongoing reads.
   - **Performance**: It performs well when there are more read operations than write operations. However, write operations (like add/remove) are relatively slow since they involve copying the entire list.
   - **Use case**: Ideal for scenarios where you have a lot of concurrent reads but infrequent writes.

2. **`ArrayList`**:
   - **Thread-safety**: `ArrayList` is **not thread-safe** by default. If multiple threads access an `ArrayList` concurrently, it may lead to data corruption unless external synchronization is used.
   - **Performance**: It is typically faster than `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for scenarios where there are frequent writes (add, remove) because there is no overhead of copying the array.
   - **Use case**: Suitable for single-threaded applications or where external synchronization can be applied.

3. **`Vector`**:
   - **Thread-safety**: `Vector` is **synchronized** like `Hashtable`, so it is thread-safe but with higher overhead than `ArrayList`. It synchronizes every method call, leading to potential performance issues in highly concurrent environments.
   - **Performance**: Slower than `ArrayList` due to synchronization.
   - **Use case**: It was used for thread-safe operations in older versions of Java but is generally replaced by other thread-safe collections like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` or `Collections.synchronizedList` in modern Java code.

### 246. **Why `ListIterator` has `add()` method but `Iterator` does not have?**

The main difference between **`Iterator`** and **`ListIterator`** in Java is the additional functionality provided by `ListIterator`. The `add()` method is available in `ListIterator` because:

- **`ListIterator`** is specifically designed to allow modifications to a list while iterating. The `add()` method allows you to **insert an element** at the current position of the iterator.
- **`Iterator`**, on the other hand, provides a simpler interface that allows only for traversing through elements (via `next()` and `hasNext()`) and removing elements with the `remove()` method. It doesn't support adding elements because it is a more basic interface designed for simple traversal.

The `add()` method in `ListIterator` allows the flexibility to modify the list while iterating, which is important for situations where you need to add elements during iteration.

### 247. **Why do we sometimes get `ConcurrentModificationException` during iteration?**

A **`ConcurrentModificationException`** occurs when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over, and the modification is not done through the iterator itself. This typically happens in the following scenarios:

1. **Modifying the collection during iteration**: If you modify a collection (e.g., adding or removing elements) directly (without using the iterator’s `remove()` method) while iterating over it, the underlying structure of the collection changes, and the iterator’s state becomes invalid.
   
2. **Fail-fast iterators**: Most iterators in Java are **fail-fast**. This means that if the collection is modified during iteration, a `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown to indicate that the iterator is no longer valid, preventing unpredictable behavior or data corruption.

**Example**:
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(1);
list.add(2);
Iterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    Integer value = iterator.next();
    list.remove(value); // Modifying the list during iteration
}
```

### 248. **How will you convert a `Map` to a `List` in Java?**

To convert a `Map` to a `List`, you typically want to convert either the keys, the values, or the entries (key-value pairs) of the map into a list. Here's how you can do each:

1. **Convert the keys to a list**:
   ```java
   Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   map.put("One", 1);
   map.put("Two", 2);
   List<String> keysList = new ArrayList<>(map.keySet());
   ```

2. **Convert the values to a list**:
   ```java
   List<Integer> valuesList = new ArrayList<>(map.values());
   ```

3. **Convert the entries (key-value pairs) to a list**:
   ```java
   List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entriesList = new ArrayList<>(map.entrySet());
   ```

In each case, you can use the `keySet()`, `values()`, or `entrySet()` methods of the `Map` to retrieve the respective collections and convert them into a `List` using the constructor of `ArrayList`.

### 249. **How can we create a Map with a reverse view and lookup in Java?**

To create a **reverse view** and **lookup** for a `Map`, you typically need to reverse the keys and values. This can be done by swapping the keys and values of the original `Map`. 

For example, if you have a `Map<K, V>`, you can create a new `Map<V, K>` that provides the reverse lookup:

```java
Map<String, Integer> originalMap = new HashMap<>();
originalMap.put("One", 1);
originalMap.put("Two", 2);
originalMap.put("Three", 3);

// Reverse the map (key-value swap)
Map<Integer, String> reverseMap = new HashMap<>();
for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : originalMap.entrySet()) {
    reverseMap.put(entry.getValue(), entry.getKey());
}
```

In this case, the `reverseMap` provides the **reverse view** where the integer values become keys, and the strings become values.

- **Lookup** can be done using this reversed map, providing a way to get the original keys based on values.

### 250. **How will you create a shallow copy of a Map?**

To create a **shallow copy** of a `Map` in Java, you can use the `putAll()` method or the copy constructor of the map. A shallow copy means that the new map will have the same entries as the original map, but the keys and values themselves are **not cloned**; they are just references to the same objects.

Here’s how to create a shallow copy:

#### Using `putAll()` method:
```java
Map<String, Integer> originalMap = new HashMap<>();
originalMap.put("One", 1);
originalMap.put("Two", 2);

// Create a shallow copy
Map<String, Integer> shallowCopy = new HashMap<>();
shallowCopy.putAll(originalMap);
```

#### Using the copy constructor:
```java
Map<String, Integer> shallowCopy = new HashMap<>(originalMap);
```

In both cases, the new `shallowCopy` map will have the same references to the keys and values as the `originalMap`. If the values are mutable objects, changes to them will affect both maps.

### 251. **Why we cannot create a generic array in Java?**

In Java, you **cannot create a generic array** due to the way **type erasure** works in generics. The Java type system erases the generic type information at runtime, which makes it difficult for the JVM to create an array of a specific generic type.

For example, you cannot do the following:

```java
T[] array = new T[10]; // Compile-time error
```

This is because the generic type `T` is erased at runtime and replaced with `Object`, so at runtime, the JVM doesn't know what type the array should be. Arrays in Java are covariant, meaning the type of the array is checked at runtime, and the JVM cannot determine the component type for a generic array.

### How to work around this limitation?
- You can create an array of `Object` and cast it to the generic type, although it’s not type-safe:
  ```java
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  T[] array = (T[]) new Object[10];
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use a **`List`** instead of an array if you need a collection of a specific type.

### 252. **What is a `PriorityQueue` in Java?**

A `PriorityQueue` in Java is a **queue** that orders its elements based on their priority. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and implements a **heap data structure** (usually a **min-heap**), where the element with the highest priority is served first. The priority of an element is determined by its natural ordering or by a `Comparator` provided at queue creation.

Key points about `PriorityQueue`:
- **Natural ordering**: By default, the queue orders the elements according to their natural ordering (i.e., using `Comparable` interface). For example, numbers are ordered in ascending order.
- **Custom ordering**: You can provide a custom order using a `Comparator` when you create the queue.
- **Not thread-safe**: `PriorityQueue` is **not thread-safe**, meaning you need to externally synchronize it if multiple threads are going to access it concurrently.
- **No capacity limit**: Unlike some other queues, `PriorityQueue` grows as needed.

Example:

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
pq.add(5);
pq.add(1);
pq.add(3);

System.out.println(pq.poll());  // Outputs 1, the smallest element by default
System.out.println(pq.poll());  // Outputs 3
System.out.println(pq.poll());  // Outputs 5
```

### 253. **What are the important points to remember while using Java Collections Framework?**

Here are some key points to remember when using the Java Collections Framework:

1. **Choose the right collection type**: Understand the use case for different collection classes. For example:
   - Use **List** (like `ArrayList`) when you need ordered and indexed data.
   - Use **Set** (like `HashSet`) when you need unique, unordered data.
   - Use **Map** (like `HashMap`) for key-value pairs.

2. **Use Generics**: Always prefer using generics with collections to avoid `ClassCastException` at runtime and to ensure type safety.
   ```java
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   ```

3. **Performance Consideration**: Understand the performance characteristics of different collections:
   - **ArrayList** provides fast random access but slow insertions/deletions.
   - **LinkedList** provides fast insertions/deletions but slower access time.
   - **HashMap** and **HashSet** provide constant time O(1) operations on average.

4. **Thread-safety**: If thread safety is required, use thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap` or synchronize the collections manually. Using synchronized wrappers (e.g., `Collections.synchronizedList()`) can add overhead and affect performance.

5. **Avoid null values**: Some collections, like `HashMap` and `HashSet`, allow `null` values, while others like `TreeMap` and `TreeSet` do not allow `null` keys or values.

6. **Know the difference between "fail-fast" and "fail-safe" iterators**: Understand the behavior when a collection is modified during iteration:
   - **Fail-fast iterators** (like in `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified during iteration.
   - **Fail-safe iterators** (like in `CopyOnWriteArrayList`) do not throw exceptions even if the collection is modified during iteration.

7. **Understand the immutability of collections**: Some collections like `Collections.unmodifiableList()` create read-only collections, which can be useful when you want to prevent modification.

---

### 254. **How can we pass a Collection as an argument to a method and ensure that method will not be able to modify it?**

To pass a collection to a method and ensure that it cannot be modified, you can use one of the following techniques:

1. **Use an unmodifiable collection**: You can wrap the collection using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`, `Collections.unmodifiableSet()`, or `Collections.unmodifiableMap()` to make it immutable.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add("A");
   list.add("B");

   // Pass an unmodifiable view of the list to the method
   someMethod(Collections.unmodifiableList(list));
   ```

2. **Use `List` or `Set` with read-only interface**: Pass the collection as a read-only interface (like `List`, `Set`, or `Map`) so that the method cannot modify the underlying collection.

   ```java
   public void someMethod(List<String> list) {
       // Method cannot modify the list as it's passed as a read-only collection
   }
   ```

3. **Use `java.util.Immutable` collections**: Some collections in Java (like `List.of()` or `Set.of()`) are inherently immutable.

---

### 255. **Can you explain how `HashMap` works in Java?**

`HashMap` in Java is a part of the `java.util` package and implements the `Map` interface. It stores key-value pairs and works based on the **hash table** structure.

Here’s how it works:
1. **Hashing**: When you insert a key-value pair, `HashMap` calculates the hash code of the key using the key’s `hashCode()` method. The hash code is then used to determine the bucket where the entry will be stored.
   
2. **Buckets**: The `HashMap` uses an array of "buckets" (or slots) to store the entries. The index for the bucket is determined by the hash code of the key, and the key-value pair is stored in that bucket.

3. **Handling Collisions**: If two keys have the same hash code (a hash collision), the `HashMap` uses a technique called **chaining**. It stores multiple entries in the same bucket by using a linked list or balanced tree (since Java 8, for a large number of collisions, it uses a balanced tree to improve performance).
   
4. **Load Factor and Capacity**: The **load factor** of a `HashMap` determines when it should resize (expand). The default load factor is 0.75. When the number of entries exceeds the product of the load factor and capacity, the `HashMap` rehashes and doubles its capacity to maintain performance.

5. **Key-Value Operations**: The time complexity for basic operations like `get()`, `put()`, and `remove()` is generally O(1), assuming a good hash function with few collisions.

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("One", 1);
map.put("Two", 2);
map.put("Three", 3);

int value = map.get("Two");  // Returns 2
```

---

### 256. **Can you explain how `HashSet` is implemented in Java?**

`HashSet` is a part of the `java.util` package and implements the `Set` interface. It is based on the `HashMap` internally and does not allow duplicate elements.

Here’s how `HashSet` works:
1. **Backing Data Structure**: `HashSet` internally uses a `HashMap` to store its elements. Every element in the `HashSet` is stored as a key in the `HashMap`, and the corresponding value is a constant (commonly a dummy object).
   
2. **Hashing**: When an element is added to the `HashSet`, it calculates the hash code for the element and determines the appropriate bucket to store it. This is the same process as in a `HashMap`.

3. **No Duplicates**: Since the `HashSet` is backed by a `HashMap`, it ensures that no duplicate elements are allowed. If an element already exists, the `put()` method will not add it again.

4. **Performance**: Like `HashMap`, the basic operations (`add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`) have an average time complexity of O(1), assuming the hash function distributes keys evenly across buckets.

Example:
```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add("A");
set.add("B");
set.add("A"); // Duplicate element, will not be added

System.out.println(set); // Output: [A, B]
```

### 257. **What is a `NavigableMap` in Java?**

`NavigableMap` is an extension of the `SortedMap` interface in Java and provides additional methods for navigating the map in both forward and reverse order. It allows you to work with maps in a more flexible way, enabling range operations and methods that return entries based on their ordering.

Key features of `NavigableMap`:
1. **Navigating in both directions**: It supports methods like `lowerKey()`, `floorKey()`, `ceilingKey()`, and `higherKey()` for looking up keys in both directions.
   
2. **Reverse order**: It allows easy access to the reverse order of the map via the `descendingMap()` method.

3. **Range operations**: Methods like `subMap()`, `headMap()`, and `tailMap()` allow you to extract parts of the map in a specific range.

Example:
```java
NavigableMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(1, "One");
map.put(2, "Two");
map.put(3, "Three");

System.out.println(map.lowerKey(3));  // Returns 2, the greatest key less than 3
System.out.println(map.ceilingKey(2)); // Returns 2, the smallest key greater than or equal to 2

NavigableMap<Integer, String> reverseMap = map.descendingMap();
System.out.println(reverseMap); // Output: {3=Three, 2=Two, 1=One}
``` 

`NavigableMap` is typically implemented by classes like `TreeMap`.

### 258. **What is the difference between `descendingKeySet()` and `descendingMap()` methods of `NavigableMap`?**

The `descendingKeySet()` and `descendingMap()` methods are both used to get the reverse (descending) view of the entries in a `NavigableMap`, but they return different types of collections:

1. **`descendingKeySet()`**:
   - Returns a `NavigableSet` view of the keys in the map, sorted in descending order.
   - It only provides access to the keys, not the key-value pairs.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   NavigableMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
   map.put(1, "One");
   map.put(2, "Two");
   map.put(3, "Three");

   NavigableSet<Integer> descendingKeys = map.descendingKeySet();
   System.out.println(descendingKeys);  // Output: [3, 2, 1]
   ```

2. **`descendingMap()`**:
   - Returns a `NavigableMap` view of the entries in the map, sorted in descending order. 
   - It provides access to both the keys and values.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   NavigableMap<Integer, String> descendingMap = map.descendingMap();
   System.out.println(descendingMap);  // Output: {3=Three, 2=Two, 1=One}
   ```

**Summary**:
- `descendingKeySet()` gives you a `NavigableSet` of keys, sorted in descending order.
- `descendingMap()` gives you a `NavigableMap` of key-value pairs, sorted in descending order.

---

### 259. **What is the advantage of `NavigableMap` over `Map`?**

The primary advantage of `NavigableMap` over a regular `Map` (such as `HashMap`) is its ability to perform more advanced operations on the map based on the ordering of keys. `NavigableMap` provides additional methods that allow you to navigate and manipulate the map in both forward and reverse directions.

Key advantages of `NavigableMap`:
1. **Navigation Methods**: Methods like `lowerKey()`, `floorKey()`, `ceilingKey()`, and `higherKey()` allow you to find the closest keys before or after a given key.
   
2. **Reverse Order**: You can easily access the map in reverse order using the `descendingMap()` and `descendingKeySet()` methods.

3. **Range Operations**: `NavigableMap` provides methods like `subMap()`, `headMap()`, and `tailMap()` that allow you to extract a portion of the map, based on a range of keys.

4. **Efficient Key Lookup**: The `NavigableMap` provides efficient range-based queries in addition to simple key-based lookups.

Example:
```java
NavigableMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(1, "One");
map.put(2, "Two");
map.put(3, "Three");

System.out.println(map.ceilingKey(2));  // Output: 2
System.out.println(map.tailMap(2));     // Output: {2=Two, 3=Three}
```

---

### 260. **What is the difference between `headMap()`, `tailMap()`, and `subMap()` methods of `NavigableMap`?**

The methods `headMap()`, `tailMap()`, and `subMap()` in `NavigableMap` are used to extract portions of the map based on keys, but they differ in the way they define the range.

1. **`headMap(K toKey)`**:
   - Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are less than `toKey`.
   - The range is **exclusive** of `toKey`.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   NavigableMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
   map.put(1, "One");
   map.put(2, "Two");
   map.put(3, "Three");

   NavigableMap<Integer, String> headMap = map.headMap(3);
   System.out.println(headMap);  // Output: {1=One, 2=Two}
   ```

2. **`tailMap(K fromKey)`**:
   - Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are greater than or equal to `fromKey`.
   - The range is **inclusive** of `fromKey`.

   Example:
   ```java
   NavigableMap<Integer, String> tailMap = map.tailMap(2);
   System.out.println(tailMap);  // Output: {2=Two, 3=Three}
   ```

3. **`subMap(K fromKey, K toKey)`**:
   - Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys range from `fromKey` (inclusive) to `toKey` (exclusive).
   
   Example:
   ```java
   NavigableMap<Integer, String> subMap = map.subMap(1, true, 3, false);
   System.out.println(subMap);  // Output: {1=One, 2=Two}
   ```

**Summary**:
- `headMap(toKey)` returns keys strictly less than `toKey`.
- `tailMap(fromKey)` returns keys greater than or equal to `fromKey`.
- `subMap(fromKey, toKey)` returns keys from `fromKey` (inclusive) to `toKey` (exclusive).

---

### 261. **How will you sort objects by Natural order in a Java List?**

To sort objects by their natural order (i.e., in the order defined by the `Comparable` interface), you can use the `Collections.sort()` method, which sorts the list in ascending order.

For the list to be sorted naturally, the objects in the list must implement the `Comparable` interface and override the `compareTo()` method.

Example:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Implement compareTo for natural order (sorting by age)
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.age, other.age);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + ": " + age;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
        people.add(new Person("John", 25));
        people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
        people.add(new Person("Bob", 20));

        // Sort the list by natural order (age)
        Collections.sort(people);

        // Output the sorted list
        System.out.println(people);
    }
}
```
Output:
```
[Bob: 20, John: 25, Alice: 30]
```

---

### 262. **How can we get a Stream from a List in Java?**

In Java, you can obtain a `Stream` from a `List` by calling the `stream()` method on the list.

Example:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Convert the List to a Stream
        Stream<Integer> numberStream = numbers.stream();

        // Perform operations on the Stream, such as filtering or mapping
        numberStream.filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                    .forEach(System.out::println);  // Output: 2, 4
    }
}
```

The `stream()` method returns a sequential stream, but you can also use `parallelStream()` for parallel processing.

### 263. **Can we get a Map from a Stream in Java?**

Yes, you can obtain a `Map` from a `Stream` in Java by using the `Collectors.toMap()` collector. This collector allows you to transform a `Stream` into a `Map` by providing two functions: one for the key and one for the value.

Example:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Alice", "Bob");

        // Convert List to a Map, where the key is the name and the value is the length of the name
        Map<String, Integer> nameLengthMap = names.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(name -> name, name -> name.length()));

        // Output the map
        System.out.println(nameLengthMap);  // Output: {John=4, Alice=5, Bob=3}
    }
}
```

In this example, we used `Collectors.toMap()` to convert the list of names into a map, where each key is a name, and the corresponding value is the length of the name.

---

### 264. **What are the popular implementations of Deque in Java?**

`Deque` (Double-Ended Queue) is a part of the Java Collections Framework and allows elements to be added or removed from both ends of the queue. Popular implementations of `Deque` in Java include:

1. **`ArrayDeque`**:
   - A resizable array-based implementation of the `Deque` interface.
   - It does not have capacity limitations like a `LinkedList`, making it more efficient for some use cases.
   - Ideal for stack and queue operations where elements are added and removed from both ends.

   Example:
   ```java
   Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
   deque.addFirst(1);
   deque.addLast(2);
   deque.removeFirst();
   deque.removeLast();
   ```

2. **`LinkedList`**:
   - Implements both the `List` and `Deque` interfaces.
   - Allows elements to be added or removed from both ends (similar to `ArrayDeque`), but it also supports operations like random access, which is not typically available in `Deque` implementations.
   - More memory-intensive than `ArrayDeque` because it uses a doubly linked list structure.

   Example:
   ```java
   Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
   deque.addFirst(1);
   deque.addLast(2);
   deque.removeFirst();
   deque.removeLast();
   ```

---

### 265. **What is a Thread in Java?**

A `Thread` in Java is a lightweight process that allows a program to perform multiple operations concurrently. Each thread has its own execution path and can run independently, which enables multitasking within a single program. A `Thread` represents a single path of execution in a program.

You can create and start a thread in Java by:

1. Extending the `Thread` class and overriding its `run()` method.
2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing it to a `Thread` object.

Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();  // Starts the thread
    }
}
```

Alternatively, using `Runnable`:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

---

### 266. **What is the priority of a Thread and how is it used in scheduling?**

The priority of a `Thread` in Java determines the relative importance of the thread compared to other threads in the system. Threads with higher priority are generally executed before those with lower priority. Thread priorities are used by the thread scheduler to decide when each thread should be executed.

In Java, thread priorities are represented by integers between **`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1)** and **`Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10)**, with the default priority being **`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5)**.

You can set the priority of a thread using the `setPriority()` method and get the current priority using `getPriority()`.

Example:
```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Set thread to highest priority
```

Thread scheduling is typically managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and it relies on the operating system's thread scheduler. While thread priorities may influence the order of execution, the JVM and OS do not guarantee strict priority scheduling.

---

### 267. **What is the default priority of a thread in Java?**

The default priority of a thread in Java is **`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`**, which has a value of **5**. This is the default priority level assigned to a thread when it is created, unless explicitly set otherwise.

Example:
```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
System.out.println(thread.getPriority());  // Output: 5 (default priority)
```

You can change the thread's priority by using the `setPriority()` method, but if not set, it will always have the default priority of 5 (`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`).

### 268. **What are the three different priorities that can be set on a Thread in Java?**

In Java, the thread priorities can be set using the `Thread` class's `setPriority()` method. There are **three main priority levels** that can be set on a thread:

1. **`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1)**: This represents the lowest possible priority. Threads with this priority are the least likely to be executed first.
2. **`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5)**: This is the default priority assigned to a thread if no priority is explicitly set. Threads with this priority are typically scheduled fairly.
3. **`Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10)**: This represents the highest possible priority. Threads with this priority are more likely to be executed before others with lower priority.

These priorities are used by the thread scheduler to decide which thread to execute, though thread scheduling ultimately depends on the underlying operating system's thread management.

Example:
```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Set the highest priority
```

---

### 269. **What is the purpose of `join()` method in Thread class?**

The `join()` method in Java is used to pause the execution of the current thread until the thread on which `join()` was called has finished executing. This method is useful when you want to ensure that one thread completes its task before the next thread starts its execution.

**Use case**: If you have multiple threads running and you want one thread to wait until another completes, you can use `join()`.

Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();    // Start the thread
        thread.join();     // Main thread will wait for thread to finish
        System.out.println("Thread has finished");
    }
}
```

Here, the `main` thread will wait for `MyThread` to finish before printing "Thread has finished".

---

### 270. **What is the fundamental difference between `wait()` and `sleep()` methods?**

- **`wait()`**:
  - Belongs to the `Object` class, not the `Thread` class.
  - Used in synchronized blocks or methods to release the lock and allow other threads to execute.
  - Causes the current thread to give up its lock and go into a waiting state until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` to wake it up.
  - Used for inter-thread communication.
  
- **`sleep()`**:
  - Belongs to the `Thread` class.
  - Causes the current thread to pause its execution for a specified time, without releasing any locks.
  - The thread will automatically wake up after the specified time.
  - Does not involve any inter-thread communication and does not release any locks.

**Summary of differences**:
- `wait()` must be used within a synchronized context, while `sleep()` does not require synchronization.
- `wait()` can be used for thread communication, but `sleep()` is typically used to pause execution for a fixed amount of time.

Example:
```java
// Example of wait()
synchronized (someObject) {
    someObject.wait();  // Current thread goes to waiting state
}

// Example of sleep()
Thread.sleep(1000);  // Current thread sleeps for 1 second
```

---

### 271. **Is it possible to call `run()` method instead of `start()` on a thread in Java?**

Yes, it is possible to call the `run()` method directly, but it is not recommended because calling `run()` directly does not start a new thread. Instead, it will simply execute the `run()` method on the current thread, which is the calling thread.

To start a new thread, you must call the `start()` method, which internally calls the `run()` method in a new thread of execution.

Example:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.run();  // This does NOT start a new thread, it calls run() in the main thread
    }
}
```

In this case, the `run()` method will execute in the main thread, not in a separate thread.

To execute `run()` in a new thread, you should use `thread.start()` instead of `thread.run()`.

---

### 272. **What is a daemon thread in Java?**

A **daemon thread** is a thread that runs in the background and does not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads have finished execution. The JVM will automatically terminate daemon threads once all non-daemon (user) threads have completed.

You can make a thread a daemon thread by calling `setDaemon(true)` before calling `start()` on the thread.

**Use case**: Daemon threads are typically used for background tasks, like garbage collection or monitoring tasks, where you don't need to explicitly wait for the thread to finish.

Example:
```java
class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            // Background task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread thread = new MyDaemonThread();
        thread.setDaemon(true);  // Make this thread a daemon thread
        thread.start();

        // Main thread ends, causing the JVM to terminate the daemon thread
    }
}
```

In this case, the `MyDaemonThread` is a daemon thread, and when the main thread ends, the JVM will terminate the daemon thread as well.

### 273. **How can we make a regular thread Daemon thread in Java?**

In Java, a thread can be made a daemon thread by calling the `setDaemon(true)` method before starting the thread. Once a thread is marked as a daemon thread, it will not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads have finished.

**Example:**
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            // Simulating some background work
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.setDaemon(true);  // Make this thread a daemon thread
        thread.start();

        // Main thread finishes, daemon thread will stop when JVM exits
    }
}
```
In the above example, `setDaemon(true)` is called before `start()`. After the main thread completes, the JVM will terminate the daemon thread as well.

---

### 274. **How will you make a user thread into daemon thread if it has already started?**

Once a thread has been started, it **cannot** be converted into a daemon thread. The `setDaemon(true)` method must be called before the `start()` method. If you attempt to call `setDaemon(true)` after a thread has already started, it will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

**Example:**
```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.start();   // Thread is already started
thread.setDaemon(true);  // This will throw IllegalThreadStateException
```

You need to ensure that `setDaemon(true)` is called before `start()` if you want to make a thread a daemon.

---

### 275. **Can we start a thread two times in Java?**

No, in Java, a thread **cannot** be started more than once. Once a thread's `start()` method is called, it is considered to be in the "started" state. Any subsequent calls to `start()` will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

**Example:**
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();  // First call to start()
        thread.start();  // This will throw IllegalThreadStateException
    }
}
```

You cannot restart a thread after it has been started, and once it completes execution, it cannot be started again.

---

### 276. **What is a Shutdown hook in Java?**

A **Shutdown hook** is a special Java thread that is executed when the JVM shuts down. It allows you to perform any cleanup or resource deallocation tasks before the JVM exits, such as closing file streams, saving data, or releasing resources.

You can register a shutdown hook by using the `Runtime.addShutdownHook(Thread hook)` method.

**Example:**
```java
public class ShutdownHookExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Register a shutdown hook
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Shutdown hook executed. Performing cleanup tasks.");
            }
        });

        System.out.println("Program is running...");
        // Simulating program execution
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);  // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Program is exiting...");
        // JVM shutdown triggers the shutdown hook
    }
}
```

In the above example, when the program exits (either normally or due to an exception), the shutdown hook will be triggered, and it will print "Shutdown hook executed. Performing cleanup tasks."

**Note**:
- Shutdown hooks are executed in the order they were registered.
- Shutdown hooks are executed in a non-deterministic order relative to each other and might not complete before the JVM terminates.
- Shutdown hooks should complete quickly; otherwise, the JVM may forcefully terminate them.

### 277. **What is synchronization in Java?**

**Synchronization** in Java is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time. It is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources to avoid inconsistent data and race conditions. In Java, synchronization is mainly achieved using the `synchronized` keyword.

When a method or block of code is synchronized, only one thread can execute that block or method at a time per object or class (depending on whether it's an instance method or static method). This ensures thread safety.

**Example:**
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
In the example above, the `increment()` and `getCount()` methods are synchronized to ensure that only one thread can modify or read the `count` variable at any given time.

---

### 278. **What is the purpose of Synchronized block in Java?**

A **synchronized block** allows more fine-grained control over synchronization. While a synchronized method locks the entire method, a synchronized block locks only a part of the code, which can help improve performance by minimizing the scope of the lock.

The syntax for a synchronized block is:

```java
synchronized (object) {
    // Code that needs synchronization
}
```

You can use synchronized blocks to lock only a specific section of code instead of the entire method, which can improve efficiency and concurrency.

**Example:**
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

In this example, only the critical section where `count++` occurs is synchronized, instead of synchronizing the entire method.

---

### 279. **What is static synchronization?**

**Static synchronization** in Java is used when you want to synchronize access to a static method. Since static methods are shared across all instances of a class, static synchronization ensures that only one thread can execute the static method at a time for the entire class, regardless of which object calls it.

You use the `synchronized` keyword on the static method to achieve this.

**Example:**
```java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;

    public static synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

In this example, `increment()` is a static method, and the `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the static method at a time, preventing race conditions for the static variable `count`.

---

### 280. **What is a Deadlock situation?**

**Deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. In a deadlock situation, each thread holds a lock on a resource and is waiting to acquire a lock on a resource held by another thread, leading to a cycle where none of the threads can proceed.

**Example of Deadlock:**
```java
class A {
    synchronized void methodA(B b) {
        b.last();
    }
    synchronized void last() {}
}

class B {
    synchronized void methodB(A a) {
        a.last();
    }
    synchronized void last() {}
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final A a = new A();
        final B b = new B();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                a.methodA(b);
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                b.methodB(a);
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, thread `t1` holds a lock on `A` and tries to acquire a lock on `B`, while thread `t2` holds a lock on `B` and tries to acquire a lock on `A`. Both threads are blocked, waiting for each other, creating a deadlock.

---

### 281. **What is the meaning of concurrency?**

**Concurrency** refers to the ability of a program to run multiple tasks or threads in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean that the tasks are executed simultaneously (this is parallelism), but it allows for multitasking by interleaving operations to make progress on multiple tasks, usually on a single processor.

Concurrency allows better utilization of system resources by performing tasks independently and managing them through multi-threading, ensuring that multiple operations can be carried out concurrently without interfering with each other.


### 282. **What is the main difference between process and thread?**

The main difference between a **process** and a **thread** lies in their execution contexts and the resources they use:

- **Process**: A process is an independent, self-contained unit of execution with its own memory space. Each process has its own address space, code, data, and resources. Processes are generally isolated from each other, and communication between processes is more complex (usually done via inter-process communication mechanisms like pipes, sockets, etc.).
  
- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads within the same process share the same memory space, code, and resources. They are sometimes called "lightweight" because they have less overhead compared to processes. Threads allow concurrent execution within a single process, and their communication is easier since they share the same memory.

In summary:
- A **process** is a heavy-weight unit with its own memory.
- A **thread** is a light-weight unit that shares the memory of the process it belongs to.

---

### 283. **What is a process and thread in the context of Java?**

In Java:
- A **process** is an instance of a Java application running in memory. It is created by the operating system when you launch a Java program. Each Java process has its own memory space and executes independently. A Java process can have multiple threads running concurrently inside it.
  
- A **thread** in Java is a unit of execution within a Java program (a process). Java threads are created by the `Thread` class or by implementing the `Runnable` interface. All threads in a Java application share the same heap memory (except for their own stack). Java supports multithreading, meaning multiple threads can run in parallel to execute different parts of the program simultaneously.

In Java, threads are managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the underlying operating system.

---

### 284. **What is a Scheduler?**

A **Scheduler** is part of the operating system or JVM that is responsible for determining the order in which threads or processes are executed. It manages the CPU's resources and allocates them to processes and threads. 

In Java, the **thread scheduler** decides which thread gets CPU time and when. Java threads can have different priorities, and the scheduler uses these priorities (along with other factors) to determine which thread to run next.

There are typically two types of scheduling:
- **Preemptive scheduling**: The scheduler can interrupt a running thread and switch to another, based on priorities or time-slicing.
- **Cooperative scheduling**: A thread runs until it voluntarily yields or completes its task.

In most operating systems, the scheduling is handled by the OS, but in Java, the JVM also plays a part in thread scheduling.

---

### 285. **What is the minimum number of Threads in a Java program?**

The minimum number of threads in a Java program is **1**. Every Java program, by default, runs with at least one thread, which is the **main thread**. This thread executes the main method of the program. Even if you don't explicitly create additional threads, the main thread itself is sufficient to run the program.

In a multi-threaded Java program, you can create additional threads to perform different tasks concurrently, but the program will always start with at least one main thread.

---

### 286. **What are the properties of a Java thread?**

In Java, a thread has several properties that define its state, behavior, and interaction with other threads:

1. **Thread Name**: Every thread has a name that is used for identification purposes. By default, the main thread is named "main," but you can set a custom name when creating a thread.

2. **Thread State**: A thread can be in one of the following states:
   - **New**: The thread has been created but not started.
   - **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run, but may not be running yet due to the operating system's scheduler.
   - **Blocked**: The thread is blocked, waiting for a resource or lock to become available.
   - **Waiting**: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action.
   - **Timed Waiting**: The thread is waiting for a specific amount of time.
   - **Terminated**: The thread has completed execution.

3. **Thread Priority**: Threads in Java can have priorities, which help the thread scheduler decide the order of execution. The priority is set with an integer value between `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) and `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10), with the default being `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5).

4. **Daemon or User Thread**: Threads in Java can be either **user threads** or **daemon threads**. Daemon threads are low-priority threads that run in the background (e.g., garbage collection). They are terminated when all user threads finish executing. Non-daemon threads are considered user threads, and the program will keep running until all user threads are terminated.

5. **Thread Group**: Threads can belong to a thread group. A thread group is a collection of threads that can be managed as a single unit. However, thread groups are considered somewhat outdated and are less commonly used in modern Java development.

6. **Thread Stack**: Each thread has its own stack for method calls and local variables. The size of the stack can vary depending on the operating system and JVM configuration.


### 287. **What are the different states of a Thread in Java?**

In Java, a thread can be in one of the following states during its lifecycle:

1. **New**: A thread is in the "New" state when it has been created but not yet started. It has been instantiated but hasn't started executing yet.

2. **Runnable**: A thread is in the "Runnable" state when the `start()` method is called. In this state, the thread is ready to run but may not be actively executing because the thread scheduler might not have given it CPU time yet.

3. **Blocked**: A thread enters the "Blocked" state when it is waiting to acquire a lock or resource that is currently being held by another thread. The thread cannot execute until it obtains the necessary lock or resource.

4. **Waiting**: A thread is in the "Waiting" state when it is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action. This can happen when a thread calls methods like `wait()`, `join()`, or `park()` without a specified time limit.

5. **Timed Waiting**: A thread is in the "Timed Waiting" state when it is waiting for a specific period. This state is entered when methods like `sleep(long millis)`, `join(long millis)`, or `wait(long millis)` are called.

6. **Terminated (Dead)**: A thread is in the "Terminated" or "Dead" state when its `run()` method has completed, either by normal termination or due to an exception. A thread cannot be restarted once it has entered the terminated state.

### 288. **How will you set the priority of a thread in Java?**

In Java, the priority of a thread can be set using the `setPriority(int priority)` method of the `Thread` class. The priority is an integer between `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) and `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10), with `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5) being the default priority.

Here’s how you can set a thread’s priority:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Set to highest priority
```

You can also use `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` or `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` based on your needs.

```java
Thread thread = new Thread();
thread.setPriority(7);  // Custom priority between 1 and 10
```

### 289. **What is the purpose of Thread Groups in Java?**

In Java, a **Thread Group** is a way to organize and manage multiple threads. Thread groups provide a mechanism to manage a set of threads as a collective unit, allowing operations to be applied to all threads in a group at once. 

Some purposes of thread groups are:
1. **Managing Groups of Threads**: You can group related threads into a single group for easier management.
2. **Controlling Thread Behavior**: You can control the behavior of all threads in a group, such as interrupting them or setting the thread’s priority.
3. **Error Handling**: Thread groups provide a way to manage the exceptions thrown by threads, especially when an uncaught exception occurs. You can define a handler that can handle uncaught exceptions for all threads within a group.

However, it is important to note that **Thread Groups** are considered outdated and should generally be avoided in modern Java development. Instead, **executors** (via the `java.util.concurrent` package) are preferred for managing threads.

### 290. **Why we should not stop a thread by calling its stop() method?**

The `stop()` method in Java is **deprecated** because it is unsafe and can cause issues with thread synchronization and shared resources. When `stop()` is called on a thread:
- It terminates the thread immediately, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.
- If the thread is holding a lock, calling `stop()` may result in a deadlock situation, as other threads may not be able to acquire the lock.
- The thread may be in the middle of an operation, leading to corrupt data or incomplete execution.

Instead of `stop()`, it’s recommended to use safer alternatives:
- Use flags to signal the thread to finish its work (e.g., `boolean stopRequested`).
- Use higher-level mechanisms like `Thread.interrupt()` to request the thread to stop cleanly.

```java
public class SafeThread {
    private volatile boolean stopRequested = false;

    public void run() {
        while (!stopRequested) {
            // Thread work
        }
    }

    public void stopThread() {
        stopRequested = true;
    }
}
```

### 291. **How will you create a Thread in Java?**

In Java, there are two primary ways to create a thread:

1. **By Extending the `Thread` class**:
   - You can create a new class that extends `Thread` and override the `run()` method, which contains the code that will execute in the new thread.

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running...");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread t = new MyThread();
           t.start();  // Start the thread
       }
   }
   ```

2. **By Implementing the `Runnable` interface**:
   - The `Runnable` interface is another way to define the code that will be executed by a thread. This approach is preferred because it allows the class to extend another class as well, since Java supports single inheritance.

   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running...");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
           Thread t = new Thread(r);
           t.start();  // Start the thread
       }
   }
   ```

### 292. **How can we stop a thread in the middle of execution in Java?**

It is **not recommended** to stop a thread abruptly in the middle of its execution. The `Thread.stop()` method was deprecated due to its unsafe behavior, which can lead to data corruption and inconsistent states. Instead, there are safer ways to stop a thread:

1. **Using a flag (boolean variable):**
   You can use a flag (e.g., `boolean stopRequested`) to signal the thread to finish its work gracefully. This method allows the thread to check the flag regularly and terminate its operation when it’s safe.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class SafeThread implements Runnable {
       private volatile boolean stopRequested = false;

       public void run() {
           while (!stopRequested) {
               // Thread's task
               System.out.println("Thread is running...");
               try {
                   Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
               } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupt status
               }
           }
           System.out.println("Thread is stopping...");
       }

       public void stopThread() {
           stopRequested = true; // Request the thread to stop
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SafeThread safeThread = new SafeThread();
           Thread thread = new Thread(safeThread);
           thread.start();
           
           // After some time
           try {
               Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds before stopping
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
           
           safeThread.stopThread(); // Stop the thread gracefully
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Using `Thread.interrupt()` method:**
   If the thread is blocked (e.g., in `sleep()`, `wait()`, or `join()`), you can call `Thread.interrupt()` to interrupt its execution. Inside the thread, you should regularly check the interrupted status and handle it accordingly.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class InterruptibleThread implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
               // Thread's task
               System.out.println("Thread is running...");
               try {
                   Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
               } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupt status
                   break; // Exit the loop if interrupted
               }
           }
           System.out.println("Thread is stopping...");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           InterruptibleThread interruptibleThread = new InterruptibleThread();
           Thread thread = new Thread(interruptibleThread);
           thread.start();
           
           // After some time
           try {
               Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds before interrupting
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
           
           thread.interrupt(); // Interrupt the thread
       }
   }
   ```

### 293. **How do you access the current thread in a Java program?**

In Java, you can access the **current thread** using the `Thread.currentThread()` method. This method returns a reference to the currently executing thread.

Example:

```java
public class CurrentThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread(); // Get current thread
        System.out.println("Current thread: " + currentThread.getName());
    }
}
```

In this example, `Thread.currentThread()` returns the `Thread` object for the current running thread. You can then call methods like `getName()` to get the name of the thread or `getId()` to get the thread ID.

### 294. **What is Busy waiting in Multi-threading?**

**Busy waiting** occurs when a thread continuously checks a condition without releasing the CPU, consuming CPU resources unnecessarily. The thread remains in a tight loop, checking for the condition to change, which can lead to poor performance as the CPU is used inefficiently.

Example of busy waiting:

```java
public class BusyWaitingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean condition = false;
        
        while (!condition) {
            // Busy waiting: continuously checking the condition
            System.out.println("Waiting...");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the thread will repeatedly check the condition, using CPU resources without doing anything productive.

### 295. **How can we prevent busy waiting in Java?**

To **prevent busy waiting**, we can use techniques that allow the thread to wait efficiently without consuming CPU resources unnecessarily. Common solutions include:

1. **Using `wait()` and `notify()`/`notifyAll()`**:
   If the thread is waiting for a condition to change, it can call `wait()` to release the CPU and be notified when the condition changes.

   Example using `wait()` and `notify()`:

   ```java
   public class WaitNotifyExample {
       private static boolean condition = false;

       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           Object lock = new Object();
           
           Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
               synchronized (lock) {
                   while (!condition) {
                       try {
                           lock.wait(); // Release the lock and wait for notification
                       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                           Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                       }
                   }
                   System.out.println("Condition met, continuing...");
               }
           });

           Thread notifyingThread = new Thread(() -> {
               try {
                   Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work
                   synchronized (lock) {
                       condition = true;
                       lock.notify(); // Notify waiting thread
                       System.out.println("Condition changed, notifying...");
                   }
               } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
               }
           });

           waitingThread.start();
           notifyingThread.start();

           waitingThread.join();
           notifyingThread.join();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Using `Thread.sleep()`**:
   If the thread needs to wait for some time, instead of busy-waiting, it can call `Thread.sleep()` to sleep for a specific time.

   ```java
   public class SleepExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           // Simulate waiting without busy waiting
           while (true) {
               System.out.println("Waiting...");
               Thread.sleep(1000);  // Sleep for 1 second
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 296. **Can we use `Thread.sleep()` method for real-time processing in Java?**

No, using `Thread.sleep()` for **real-time processing** is not recommended. The `Thread.sleep()` method is not guaranteed to provide precise control over thread timing because it relies on the underlying operating system's thread scheduling, which can be affected by system load or other factors. 

In **real-time systems**, where precise timing and high reliability are required, `Thread.sleep()` can introduce unpredictable delays, which is not suitable for hard real-time applications.

For real-time processing, you might want to use a **real-time operating system (RTOS)** or libraries that provide real-time capabilities like **Java Real-Time Specification (RTSJ)**, which provide more accurate timing and scheduling guarantees.

### 297. **Can we wake up a thread that has been put to sleep by using Thread.sleep() method?**

No, you cannot directly **wake up** a thread that has been put to sleep using `Thread.sleep()`. Once a thread is asleep, it will remain in the sleeping state until the specified time has passed, or until it is interrupted by another thread. 

You can, however, **interrupt** the sleeping thread by calling `thread.interrupt()`, which will cause an `InterruptedException` to be thrown, effectively "waking up" the thread prematurely, if it is sleeping or waiting. The thread must handle this exception (usually in a `catch` block).

Example:

```java
public class WakeUpExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Thread going to sleep...");
                Thread.sleep(5000);
                System.out.println("Thread woke up!");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread was interrupted!");
            }
        });
        
        thread.start();
        
        // Interrupt the thread while it's sleeping
        Thread.sleep(2000);  // Wait for 2 seconds before interrupting
        thread.interrupt();
        
        thread.join();  // Wait for the thread to finish
    }
}
```

In this example, the thread will sleep for 5 seconds, but after 2 seconds, it will be interrupted, and the `InterruptedException` will be thrown.

### 298. **What are the two ways to check if a Thread has been interrupted?**

In Java, there are two common ways to check if a thread has been interrupted:

1. **Using `Thread.interrupted()` method:**
   This static method checks whether the current thread has been interrupted and **clears** the interrupted status. It returns `true` if the thread has been interrupted.

   Example:

   ```java
   if (Thread.interrupted()) {
       System.out.println("Current thread was interrupted.");
   }
   ```

2. **Using `Thread.isInterrupted()` method:**
   This instance method checks if the thread has been interrupted **without clearing** the interrupt status. It returns `true` if the thread has been interrupted.

   Example:

   ```java
   Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
       // Do some work
   });

   thread.start();
   
   if (thread.isInterrupted()) {
       System.out.println("Thread has been interrupted.");
   }
   ```

### 299. **How can we make sure that the Parent thread waits for the termination of the Child thread?**

You can ensure that the **parent thread** waits for the termination of the **child thread** by using the `join()` method of the `Thread` class. When the `join()` method is called on a thread, the calling thread (the parent thread) will be paused until the thread on which `join()` was called (the child thread) finishes its execution.

Example:

```java
public class ParentChildExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread childThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Child thread is running...");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work
                System.out.println("Child thread finished.");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        childThread.start();

        // Parent thread waits for child thread to finish
        childThread.join();

        System.out.println("Parent thread finished after child thread.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the parent thread calls `childThread.join()`, causing the parent thread to wait until the `childThread` completes.

### 300. **How will you handle InterruptedException in Java?**

When a thread is interrupted while it is executing, it may throw an `InterruptedException`, which needs to be handled. There are different ways to handle this exception, depending on the context of your program.

Here are the common approaches for handling `InterruptedException`:

1. **Restoring the interrupt status**:
   If the interrupt status of the thread needs to be preserved (e.g., if the thread should propagate the interruption to higher levels), it is common practice to **restore the interrupt flag** after catching the `InterruptedException`.

   Example:

   ```java
   try {
       // Some code that may throw InterruptedException
       Thread.sleep(1000);  // Simulate some work
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupt status
       System.out.println("Thread was interrupted and interrupt status restored.");
   }
   ```

   By calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`, you ensure that the interrupt status is not lost, allowing other parts of your program to be aware that the thread has been interrupted.

2. **Logging or handling the exception**:
   Sometimes you may need to log the interrupt event, handle the exception, and allow the thread to exit or take corrective action.

   Example:

   ```java
   try {
       // Some code that may throw InterruptedException
       Thread.sleep(1000);  // Simulate some work
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       // Log or handle the interrupt
       System.out.println("Interrupt received: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

3. **Exiting the thread**:
   If the interruption is a signal to terminate the thread (for example, in a loop or a long-running task), you may exit the thread immediately after handling the exception.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class InterruptedThreadExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
               while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                   try {
                       // Some code that might throw InterruptedException
                       Thread.sleep(1000);  // Simulate work
                   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                       // Handle interruption and exit thread
                       System.out.println("Thread was interrupted. Exiting...");
                       break;  // Exit the loop and terminate the thread
                   }
               }
           });

           thread.start();
           
           // Simulate interruption from another thread
           try {
               Thread.sleep(3000);
               thread.interrupt();
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, the `InterruptedException` is caught and the thread terminates by breaking the loop.

In summary, when handling `InterruptedException`, you can either **restore the interrupt flag**, **log the interruption**, or **terminate** the thread depending on your use case.

### 301. **Which intrinsic lock is acquired by a synchronized method in Java?**

In Java, a synchronized method acquires the **intrinsic lock** (also known as a **monitor lock**) of the object on which the method is invoked. 

- For an **instance method**, the lock is acquired on the **current instance of the class** (i.e., `this`).
- For a **static method**, the lock is acquired on the **class object** (`ClassName.class`).

Example for an instance method:

```java
public synchronized void myMethod() {
    // Code that requires synchronized access
}
```

Example for a static method:

```java
public static synchronized void myStaticMethod() {
    // Code that requires synchronized access
}
```

### 302. **Can we mark a constructor as synchronized in Java?**

No, in Java, you **cannot** mark a constructor as `synchronized`. This is because a constructor is used to create an object, and synchronization on a constructor would mean trying to lock an object that does not yet exist. 

If you need to synchronize access to the object creation process, you should synchronize the method or block of code that creates the object instead of synchronizing the constructor.

Example of incorrect code:

```java
// This will cause a compilation error
public synchronized MyClass() {
    // Constructor code
}
```

### 303. **Can we use primitive values for intrinsic locks?**

No, primitive values like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc., cannot be used for intrinsic locks in Java. Intrinsic locks (monitor locks) can only be acquired on **objects**, not on primitive values.

Java requires that synchronization must be done on an object (or class for static methods), so primitive values cannot be used as locks. You should use **boxed types** like `Integer`, `Character`, `Boolean`, etc., for synchronization if needed.

Example:

```java
// This will cause a compilation error
synchronized (5) {
    // Code
}
```

However, you can synchronize on an object reference, such as:

```java
Integer lock = 5;  // Wrapping the primitive type in a Boxed class
synchronized (lock) {
    // Code
}
```

### 304. **Do we have re-entrant property in intrinsic locks?**

Yes, **intrinsic locks** in Java are **re-entrant** (also known as **recursive**). This means that if a thread already holds the lock on an object, it can re-enter the synchronized block or method on that same object without causing a deadlock.

- If a thread enters a synchronized block, it holds the lock. If the same thread tries to enter another synchronized block that requires the same lock, it is allowed to do so.
- The thread has to release the lock once it exits the synchronized block, and only then will other threads be allowed to acquire the lock.

This is the reason why the **same thread** can safely invoke synchronized methods within itself without blocking itself.

Example:

```java
public class ReentrantLockExample {
    synchronized void method1() {
        System.out.println("Inside method1");
        method2();  // Calling another synchronized method
    }

    synchronized void method2() {
        System.out.println("Inside method2");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantLockExample example = new ReentrantLockExample();
        example.method1();  // This will work fine without deadlock
    }
}
```

Here, the thread that enters `method1()` can call `method2()` without any issues, as intrinsic locks are re-entrant.

### 305. **What is an atomic operation?**

An **atomic operation** in computing refers to an operation that is **indivisible** and **uninterruptible**. It either completes entirely or not at all, without any intermediate states visible to other threads or processes. 

In the context of Java, atomic operations ensure that a particular operation on a shared resource (e.g., a variable) is done safely without interference from other threads. If an operation is atomic, it guarantees that no other thread can observe the operation halfway.

For example, incrementing a variable like `counter++` is **not atomic** because it involves multiple steps (read, increment, and write), and another thread could potentially interfere between these steps. To make such an operation atomic, Java provides the `AtomicInteger` class in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package:

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

// Atomic operation (thread-safe)
counter.incrementAndGet();
```

The `incrementAndGet()` method in `AtomicInteger` is atomic, meaning it ensures that the counter is updated atomically, without interference from other threads. Similarly, other methods like `compareAndSet()` or `addAndGet()` provide atomic behavior for different operations.

### 306. **Can we consider the statement `i++` as an atomic operation in Java?**

No, the statement `i++` is **not** an atomic operation in Java.

While it may seem like a simple operation, `i++` actually involves **multiple steps**:

1. Reading the value of `i`.
2. Incrementing the value by 1.
3. Writing the updated value back to `i`.

In a multi-threaded environment, if multiple threads perform `i++` concurrently, there's a possibility of a **race condition**, where two threads might read the same value of `i` before either writes the updated value. This could result in incorrect behavior.

For example:

```java
int i = 0;

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    i++;  // Thread 1 increments i
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
    i++;  // Thread 2 increments i
});
```

Here, both threads might read the value of `i` as `0` and then increment it, resulting in `i` being `1` instead of the expected `2`. 

To make the operation atomic, you can use `AtomicInteger` in Java:

```java
AtomicInteger i = new AtomicInteger(0);

i.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation
```

### 307. **What are the Atomic operations in Java?**

In Java, **atomic operations** are provided primarily through the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package. These operations ensure that a given action is completed in a single, indivisible step, without interference from other threads.

Common atomic operations in Java include:

- **AtomicInteger**: Provides atomic methods for incrementing, decrementing, and comparing the integer value.
    - `incrementAndGet()`
    - `decrementAndGet()`
    - `addAndGet()`
    - `compareAndSet()`
    - `getAndSet()`

- **AtomicLong**: Similar to `AtomicInteger` but for `long` values.
- **AtomicBoolean**: Allows atomic manipulation of boolean values.
    - `getAndSet()`
    - `compareAndSet()`
    - `get()`

- **AtomicReference**: Provides atomic reference manipulation for objects.
    - `get()`
    - `set()`
    - `compareAndSet()`

- **AtomicMarkableReference**: Provides atomic reference manipulation, but with an additional **boolean mark**.

### 308. **Can you check if the following code is thread-safe?**

Unfortunately, the code you're referring to is not provided in the question. To assess whether a piece of code is thread-safe, we would need to look for potential race conditions, shared resource access, synchronization, and concurrent modifications.

In general, a piece of code is **not thread-safe** if:
- Multiple threads can access shared resources (variables, objects, etc.) without proper synchronization.
- There are operations that are not atomic and can be interrupted by another thread.

If you provide the code, I can help analyze it for thread-safety.

### 309. **What are the minimum requirements for a Deadlock situation in a program?**

A **deadlock** in Java (or in any multi-threaded program) occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever because they are waiting on each other to release resources. For a deadlock to occur, the following **four conditions** must be met simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource is held in a non-shareable mode. Only one thread can hold the resource at any given time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread holding them; they must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of threads exists such that each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the cycle.

### 310. **How can we prevent a Deadlock?**

Deadlocks can be prevented by addressing one or more of the four conditions required for a deadlock to occur. Here are several strategies to prevent deadlocks:

1. **Avoid Nested Locks**: Try to avoid acquiring multiple locks at once. If you must acquire more than one lock, always acquire them in a consistent order across all threads. This eliminates the circular wait condition.

    Example:
    - Always acquire lock `A` before lock `B`.
    - Never acquire lock `B` before lock `A`.

2. **Lock Timeout**: Use a timeout when trying to acquire locks. If a thread cannot acquire a lock within a certain period, it should release the resources it already holds and retry. This helps to avoid situations where a thread is indefinitely waiting for a lock.

    Example using `ReentrantLock`:
    ```java
    ReentrantLock lockA = new ReentrantLock();
    ReentrantLock lockB = new ReentrantLock();

    try {
        if (lockA.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            try {
                if (lockB.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                    // Critical section
                } else {
                    // Failed to acquire lockB
                }
            } finally {
                lockA.unlock();
            }
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle interruption
    }
    ```

3. **Use a Lock Hierarchy**: Impose a strict order in which locks must be acquired. This helps prevent circular waiting.

4. **Use Concurrency Utilities**: Java provides several concurrency utilities like `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`, `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, and `CyclicBarrier`, which have built-in deadlock prevention mechanisms and are easier to manage.

5. **Avoid Holding Locks for Long Periods**: Keep the scope of locked code as narrow as possible. The longer a thread holds a lock, the more likely it is that other threads will be blocked.

### 311. **How can we detect a Deadlock situation?**

Deadlock detection involves identifying the conditions where threads are blocked indefinitely because they are waiting for each other to release resources. Here are a few ways to detect deadlock in Java:

1. **Thread Dumps**: You can use thread dumps to analyze the state of all threads in your Java application. A thread dump will show you the current stack trace of each thread, and if threads are waiting for each other in a circular fashion, it indicates a deadlock.
   - To generate a thread dump, you can use:
     - `jstack` command (for Java applications running on a JVM).
     - `Ctrl + Break` (on Windows, for certain IDEs).
     - `kill -3` command (on Unix-based systems).

2. **Java VisualVM or JConsole**: These tools, part of the JDK, can be used to monitor and profile Java applications. They show thread activity and can indicate if threads are stuck waiting for locks.

3. **Deadlock Detection via `ThreadMXBean`**: The `java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean` class in Java provides the ability to check for deadlocks programmatically. You can query the JVM to check if there are any threads involved in a deadlock.

   Example:
   ```java
   import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;
   import java.lang.management.ThreadInfo;
   import java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean;

   public class DeadlockDetection {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
           long[] deadlockedThreads = threadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads();
           if (deadlockedThreads != null) {
               ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(deadlockedThreads);
               for (ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadInfos) {
                   System.out.println("Deadlocked Thread: " + threadInfo.getThreadName());
               }
           } else {
               System.out.println("No deadlock detected.");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### 312. **What is a Livelock?**

A **livelock** is a situation where two or more threads are actively trying to acquire resources or take actions to proceed, but are continuously failing and retrying without making any actual progress. Unlike deadlock, where threads are completely blocked, in livelock, the threads are constantly changing states but are still unable to complete their tasks.

In a **livelock**:
- Threads are not blocked; they are just constantly performing actions that prevent them from progressing.
- It occurs when threads or processes continuously interact with each other in a way that they never reach their goal.

Example of a livelock:
```java
public class LivelockExample {
    static class Robot {
        private String name;
        public Robot(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        public void tryToMove() {
            System.out.println(name + " is trying to move.");
            // Attempt to move and avoid collision
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Robot robot1 = new Robot("Robot1");
        Robot robot2 = new Robot("Robot2");
        
        // Simulating livelock: Robots continuously try to avoid each other, but never move
        while (true) {
            robot1.tryToMove();
            robot2.tryToMove();
        }
    }
}
```
In the above example, both robots are constantly trying to avoid each other but never move, which is a livelock.

### 313. **What is Thread starvation?**

**Thread starvation** occurs when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources (such as CPU time) due to other threads continuously acquiring those resources. This happens typically when thread scheduling favors some threads over others, leading to one thread being unable to run for a long period.

Thread starvation typically occurs when:
- Threads with higher priority keep consuming CPU resources, and low-priority threads are never scheduled to run.
- Improper use of locks, where one or more threads keep acquiring the locks, preventing others from proceeding.

### 314. **How can a synchronized block cause Thread starvation in Java?**

A **synchronized block** can cause thread starvation when multiple threads are competing for the same lock, and the lock is held by a thread for an extended period of time. This prevents other threads from acquiring the lock and progressing, leading to starvation.

Example scenario:
- If one thread has a long-running task inside a synchronized block, and other threads are waiting to acquire the lock, they may be blocked indefinitely, causing thread starvation for those threads.

In this example, if `task1()` holds the lock for a long time, `task2()` and `task3()` may never get a chance to execute:
```java
public class ThreadStarvationExample {
    private static final Object lock = new Object();
    
    public static void task1() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            // Long-running task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulating long task
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void task2() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            System.out.println("Task 2 is running.");
        }
    }
    
    public static void task3() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            System.out.println("Task 3 is running.");
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(ThreadStarvationExample::task1);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(ThreadStarvationExample::task2);
        Thread t3 = new Thread(ThreadStarvationExample::task3);
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
```
In this case, `task2()` and `task3()` may be starved because `task1()` holds the lock for a long time.

### 315. **What is a Race condition?**

A **race condition** occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of threads. Specifically, it happens when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and at least one thread modifies the data, leading to unpredictable results or inconsistent data.

In a race condition, the outcome depends on the order in which the threads execute, and this order is often non-deterministic.

Example of a race condition:
```java
public class RaceConditionExample {
    private static int counter = 0;

    public static void incrementCounter() {
        counter++; // Race condition here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(RaceConditionExample::incrementCounter);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(RaceConditionExample::incrementCounter);
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Counter: " + counter); // Output may not always be 2
    }
}
```
In this example, both `t1` and `t2` are incrementing `counter`, but because the operation `counter++` is not atomic, the threads may read the same value and both increment it, causing the final value of `counter` to be less than expected.

### Solutions to Race Conditions:
- Use synchronization (`synchronized` block/method).
- Use atomic classes like `AtomicInteger` for atomic operations.
- Use higher-level concurrency constructs like `Locks` to ensure proper access control to shared data.

### 316. **What is a Fair lock in multi-threading?**

A **fair lock** in multi-threading refers to a type of lock that ensures threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it. This means that threads are given a chance to access the critical section in a first-come, first-served manner. A fair lock prevents thread starvation, where a thread might never get access to the lock because other threads continuously acquire it.

In Java, a **ReentrantLock** can be configured as a fair lock by passing `true` to its constructor:
```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
```
If the lock is fair, it guarantees that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.

### 317. **Which two methods of Object class can be used to implement a Producer-Consumer scenario?**

In a **Producer-Consumer** scenario, two methods from the `Object` class are commonly used to facilitate synchronization between threads:
1. **`wait()`**: This method is used by a thread to release the lock and wait until another thread notifies it.
2. **`notify()`**: This method is used by a thread to wake up one thread that is waiting on the object's monitor.

Additionally, **`notifyAll()`** can be used to wake up all waiting threads.

Example of Producer-Consumer using `wait()` and `notify()`:
```java
class ProducerConsumer {
    private static final Object lock = new Object();
    private static int data = 0;

    // Producer thread
    static class Producer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data != 0) { // wait if data is already produced
                    try {
                        lock.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 1; // produce data
                System.out.println("Produced data: " + data);
                lock.notify(); // notify consumer
            }
        }
    }

    // Consumer thread
    static class Consumer implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data == 0) { // wait if no data to consume
                    try {
                        lock.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                System.out.println("Consumed data: " + data);
                data = 0; // consume data
                lock.notify(); // notify producer
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread producer = new Thread(new Producer());
        Thread consumer = new Thread(new Consumer());
        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

### 318. **How JVM determines which thread should wake up on `notify()`?**

In Java, when a thread calls `notify()` to wake up one of the threads that are waiting on an object's monitor, the JVM does not guarantee which specific thread will wake up. The JVM typically wakes up a single waiting thread in an arbitrary manner. The specific thread that wakes up is determined by the thread scheduler and can vary based on factors such as the order in which threads are waiting or other platform-specific factors.

If multiple threads are waiting on the same object, the JVM's thread scheduler decides which thread to wake up. The choice could be influenced by:
- Thread priorities (though thread scheduling is platform-dependent).
- The order in which threads enter the waiting state.

If you need to wake up a specific thread in a fair manner, you can use more advanced mechanisms like `ReentrantLock` with fair locking, which ensures a specific order of thread acquisition.

### 319. **Check if following code is thread-safe for retrieving an integer value from a Queue?**

To determine whether the code is thread-safe for retrieving an integer value from a `Queue`, we need to inspect the actual implementation. Here’s an example scenario:
```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

// Producer thread
new Thread(() -> {
    synchronized(queue) {
        queue.add(1);
    }
}).start();

// Consumer thread
new Thread(() -> {
    synchronized(queue) {
        Integer value = queue.poll();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
    }
}).start();
```

In this example, synchronization on the queue object (`queue`) ensures that only one thread (either the producer or the consumer) can access the queue at a time. While the synchronization prevents concurrent modification, there are several issues to consider:

1. **Correct synchronization**: This approach can work, but only if you synchronize on the same object (`queue`) for all operations on the queue.
2. **Potential performance bottlenecks**: Using `synchronized` on the entire `queue` may reduce performance because both threads (producer and consumer) are forced to acquire and release the lock on the same object.
3. **Using thread-safe collections**: A better approach might be to use thread-safe queue implementations, such as `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` or `LinkedBlockingQueue`.

Thus, while this code could be thread-safe, it's a better practice to use a thread-safe queue rather than manually synchronizing the access to the queue.

### 320. **How can we check if a thread has a monitor lock on a given object?**

In Java, you can use the **`ThreadMXBean`** to detect if a thread holds a monitor lock on a specific object. This can be done by checking for deadlock situations or by inspecting the thread’s stack.

However, Java doesn't provide a direct API to check if a specific thread holds a lock on a specific object. You can indirectly check this by using methods like `Thread.holdsLock(Object obj)`.

Example:
```java
public class MonitorLockExample {
    private static final Object lock = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {
                // Thread holds lock here
                System.out.println(Thread.holdsLock(lock)); // Should print true
            }
        });

        thread.start();
        
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the method `Thread.holdsLock(lock)` checks if the current thread holds the lock on the `lock` object, and it will return `true` when the thread has acquired the lock.

### 321. **What is the use of `yield()` method in Thread class?**

The `yield()` method in the `Thread` class is a static method that suggests to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU. This is essentially a hint that the thread is giving up its remaining time slice so that other threads can run. It doesn't guarantee that the thread will immediately stop executing or that another thread will run. The `yield()` method can cause the thread to:
- Pause for the current time slice or quantum.
- Allow other threads of the same or higher priority to execute.

Example:
```java
public class YieldExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: " + i);
                Thread.yield(); // Yielding the current thread's time slice
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: " + i);
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
In the above example, thread1 calls `yield()`, which suggests that thread1 gives up its remaining time to allow thread2 to execute. However, the behavior depends on the thread scheduler and might not always work as expected.

### 322. **What is an important point to consider while passing an object from one thread to another thread?**

When passing an object between threads, the **safety of the object's state** is a critical concern. Specifically, there are a few important points to consider:
- **Synchronization**: If the object is mutable and multiple threads will be accessing or modifying it, you need to ensure proper synchronization to avoid data inconsistency and race conditions. For example, you might need to use `synchronized` blocks or locks to control access to the object.
- **Thread-Safety**: If the object is shared between threads, it should ideally be thread-safe (i.e., designed to handle concurrent access without corruption). Using thread-safe collections, such as `ConcurrentHashMap` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, can help.
- **Visibility**: Changes made to the object by one thread may not be immediately visible to other threads unless proper synchronization (like `volatile` variables or locks) is used. To ensure visibility, consider using `volatile` fields or `synchronized` blocks.

For example:
```java
public class SharedObjectExample {
    private static volatile boolean flag = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread writer = new Thread(() -> {
            // Writing to shared object
            flag = true;
        });

        Thread reader = new Thread(() -> {
            // Reading shared object
            while (!flag) {
                // Busy-waiting
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is true");
        });

        writer.start();
        reader.start();
    }
}
```
In this case, using `volatile` ensures that the change to `flag` is visible to the reader thread immediately.

### 323. **What are the rules for creating Immutable Objects?**

To create an **immutable object** in Java, follow these rules:
1. **Declare the class as `final`**: To prevent subclassing and ensure the object's integrity.
   ```java
   public final class ImmutableClass { }
   ```
2. **Declare all fields as `final`**: To ensure that fields cannot be changed once the object is constructed.
   ```java
   private final String name;
   ```
3. **Do not provide "setter" methods**: Setter methods would allow fields to be modified after object creation.
   ```java
   // public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } // Do not provide such methods
   ```
4. **Ensure fields are initialized in the constructor**: All fields should be initialized in the constructor, and their values should not change after that.
   ```java
   public ImmutableClass(String name) {
       this.name = name;
   }
   ```
5. **If a field is a reference to a mutable object, return a copy**: If the object holds references to mutable objects (like arrays or lists), make sure to return a copy of the object in getter methods to prevent external modifications.
   ```java
   public class ImmutableClass {
       private final List<String> data;

       public ImmutableClass(List<String> data) {
           this.data = new ArrayList<>(data); // Copy constructor
       }

       public List<String> getData() {
           return new ArrayList<>(data); // Return a copy of the data
       }
   }
   ```

### 324. **What is the use of `ThreadLocal` class?**

The `ThreadLocal` class provides thread-local variables. Each thread accessing a `ThreadLocal` variable has its own independent copy of the variable. This ensures that each thread has a separate instance of the variable, which can be modified without affecting other threads.

Common use cases of `ThreadLocal` include:
- Storing user sessions in web applications.
- Storing database connections or thread-specific data.
- Implementing thread-safe counters or unique identifiers.

Example:
```java
public class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            threadLocal.set(1);
            System.out.println("Thread 1: " + threadLocal.get());
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            threadLocal.set(2);
            System.out.println("Thread 2: " + threadLocal.get());
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
Here, each thread has its own copy of the `ThreadLocal` variable, so the outputs will be independent for each thread.

### 325. **What are the scenarios suitable for using `ThreadLocal` class?**

The `ThreadLocal` class is suitable for scenarios where each thread needs to have its own independent copy of a variable, ensuring that threads do not interfere with each other and that no synchronization is needed. Some typical use cases include:

1. **Database connections or session objects**: In multi-threaded web applications, each thread may need a separate database connection or session object. Using `ThreadLocal`, each thread gets its own copy without conflicts.
   ```java
   private static ThreadLocal<DatabaseConnection> connection = ThreadLocal.withInitial(DatabaseConnection::new);
   ```

2. **User sessions**: For web servers, the session information (like user preferences, locale settings) can be stored using `ThreadLocal`, ensuring each thread has its own session context.
   ```java
   private static ThreadLocal<UserSession> userSession = ThreadLocal.withInitial(UserSession::new);
   ```

3. **Simple thread-local variables**: Any situation where you need per-thread variables, such as thread-local counters or random number generators, can benefit from `ThreadLocal`.
   ```java
   private static ThreadLocal<Integer> counter = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);
   ```

4. **Performance optimization**: For situations where you want to avoid synchronization overhead on shared variables (like counters), `ThreadLocal` provides an efficient way to have thread-local copies of the variables.

In summary, `ThreadLocal` is useful when you want to have distinct copies of data per thread and avoid synchronization overhead. It is particularly suitable for storing per-thread information that needs to be independent across different threads.

### 326. **How will you improve the performance of an application by multi-threading?**

To improve the performance of an application using multi-threading, the key strategies include:

1. **Parallelizing Independent Tasks**: Break the application into independent or loosely coupled tasks that can be executed concurrently. By doing this, multiple threads can perform work in parallel, making the application faster.

2. **Avoiding Blocking Operations**: Ensure that threads don't block each other unnecessarily. For example, use non-blocking IO, concurrent data structures, and avoid unnecessary synchronization.

3. **Optimizing CPU Utilization**: In CPU-bound applications, multi-threading can be used to fully utilize the CPU cores. By distributing the workload across multiple threads, you can increase the overall throughput of the system.

4. **Improving Responsiveness in UI Applications**: In UI applications, using multi-threading allows background tasks (like data fetching or processing) to run without blocking the main UI thread, keeping the application responsive.

5. **Asynchronous Execution**: For IO-bound applications, use multi-threading to perform blocking operations asynchronously (e.g., reading files, network calls) without stalling the main execution flow.

6. **Load Balancing**: Distribute the workload evenly across multiple threads to avoid overloading a single thread, which would limit performance.

7. **Thread Pooling**: Use thread pools to manage a fixed number of threads efficiently. This prevents overhead from creating and destroying threads frequently, which can degrade performance.

### 327. **What is scalability in a Software program?**

**Scalability** refers to the ability of a software application or system to handle an increasing amount of load or to be capable of being enlarged to accommodate that growth. It can be of two types:

1. **Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up)**: Increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more resources (CPU, memory, storage). This approach is often limited by the maximum capacity of the hardware.
   
2. **Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out)**: Distributing the load across multiple machines or nodes. This is typically more flexible than vertical scalability and can allow the system to grow as needed by adding more machines to the infrastructure.

A scalable system can efficiently handle increases in users, data, or workload without requiring a complete redesign or performance degradation.

### 328. **How will you calculate the maximum speed up of an application by using multiple processors?**

The **maximum speedup** of an application using multiple processors can be calculated using **Amdahl’s Law**, which gives the theoretical maximum improvement in performance for a fixed workload given a number of processors. 

Amdahl’s Law is given by:

\[
S_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}}
\]

Where:
- \(S_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum speedup.
- \(P\) is the proportion of the application that can be parallelized.
- \(N\) is the number of processors.

The equation shows that the speedup is limited by the part of the program that cannot be parallelized (1 - P). As the number of processors increases, the speedup approaches a limit.

**Example:**
If 80% of the program can be parallelized (\(P = 0.8\)) and 4 processors are used (\(N = 4\)), the maximum speedup would be:

\[
S_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.8) + \frac{0.8}{4}} = \frac{1}{0.2 + 0.2} = 2.5
\]

Thus, the maximum theoretical speedup would be 2.5 times faster with 4 processors.

### 329. **What is Lock contention in multi-threading?**

**Lock contention** occurs when multiple threads try to acquire the same lock or resource at the same time. When a thread cannot immediately acquire a lock because another thread holds it, it must wait for the lock to become available. This waiting can degrade performance and cause delays, particularly in a system with a high level of concurrency.

Lock contention is common in programs with shared resources where threads need exclusive access. The more threads that contend for the same lock, the greater the contention, which leads to reduced parallelism and slower performance.

### 330. **What are the techniques to reduce Lock contention?**

To reduce lock contention, you can use the following techniques:

1. **Fine-Grained Locking**: Instead of using a single lock for large sections of code, break the code into smaller parts and use multiple locks, allowing different threads to access different parts concurrently.

2. **Lock Splitting**: This involves splitting a single lock into several smaller locks, each protecting a smaller section of data. This reduces contention by allowing different threads to lock different data independently.

3. **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Use data structures that don’t require locks, such as **ConcurrentLinkedQueue** or **AtomicInteger**, which rely on atomic operations to ensure thread safety without the need for traditional locking mechanisms.

4. **Using `ReadWriteLock`**: If your application has a pattern where data is read much more frequently than written, you can use a `ReadWriteLock`. This allows multiple threads to read the data concurrently while ensuring exclusive access to writers.

5. **Optimistic Locking**: Use optimistic techniques like **versioning** or **compare-and-swap (CAS)**, where a thread assumes it can complete its work without conflict and checks for conflicts before committing changes.

6. **Thread Local Storage**: Avoid sharing data between threads. Using **ThreadLocal** variables allows each thread to have its own copy of data, which reduces the need for synchronization and lock contention.

7. **Reduce Lock Granularity**: Minimize the scope of code that is protected by a lock. Ensure that the critical section is as small as possible, reducing the time a thread holds a lock.

8. **Exponential Backoff**: If a thread cannot acquire a lock, it can back off for a random or exponentially increasing time before retrying. This reduces the likelihood that threads will keep competing for the lock continuously.


### 331. **What technique can be used in the following code to reduce Lock contention?**

To reduce lock contention in a code segment, you can employ several techniques, depending on the specifics of the code. Common approaches include:

1. **Lock Splitting**: Break a large lock into smaller locks. This way, threads only lock the critical section they need and avoid blocking other threads unnecessarily.
   
2. **Lock-Free Data Structures**: If possible, use concurrent collections or data structures that do not require locks, such as **ConcurrentHashMap**, **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**, or **Atomic** classes. These provide thread-safety without traditional locking mechanisms.

3. **Optimistic Locking**: Use mechanisms like **compare-and-swap (CAS)** or **version numbers** to allow threads to perform operations without acquiring locks but ensuring consistency at the end of the operation.

4. **Reducing Lock Granularity**: Minimize the section of code that is locked to only what is strictly necessary. This ensures that threads are not unnecessarily delayed while trying to acquire a lock.

5. **Read-Write Locks**: If the code involves frequent reads and fewer writes, use **ReadWriteLock** to allow multiple threads to read data concurrently while still ensuring exclusive access for writes.

6. **Thread Local Storage**: Use **ThreadLocal** variables where applicable, so each thread works on its own copy of data, reducing the need for synchronization.

Without the actual code to analyze, these techniques are general approaches that can help reduce lock contention in multi-threaded scenarios.

---

### 332. **What is Lock splitting technique?**

**Lock splitting** is a technique where a single lock protecting a larger critical section is split into multiple smaller locks, each protecting a subset of the data. This reduces the chance of lock contention, as multiple threads can work on different parts of the data concurrently, without needing to wait for each other to acquire a single, large lock.

For example, if a shared object contains multiple attributes, instead of synchronizing the whole object, lock each attribute independently so that threads can access different parts of the object without blocking each other.

**Benefits of Lock Splitting:**
- Reduces contention by allowing concurrent access to different parts of the data.
- Increases parallelism and improves performance.

**Example:**
If a shared object has two fields (e.g., `fieldA` and `fieldB`), instead of synchronizing the entire object, you could synchronize access to each field separately.

```java
public class LockSplitExample {
    private final Object lockA = new Object();
    private final Object lockB = new Object();

    private int fieldA;
    private int fieldB;

    public void updateFieldA(int value) {
        synchronized (lockA) {
            fieldA = value;
        }
    }

    public void updateFieldB(int value) {
        synchronized (lockB) {
            fieldB = value;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, threads can modify `fieldA` and `fieldB` concurrently without blocking each other.

---

### 333. **Which technique is used in ReadWriteLock class for reducing Lock contention?**

The **ReadWriteLock** class reduces lock contention by allowing multiple threads to **read** concurrently while ensuring that **write** operations are exclusive.

- **Read Locks**: Multiple threads can hold the read lock at the same time, as long as no thread holds the write lock. This is beneficial for read-heavy workloads, as it maximizes concurrency by allowing threads to read the shared resource concurrently.
  
- **Write Lock**: The write lock is exclusive, meaning only one thread can hold the write lock at any time, and no other thread (neither reading nor writing) can access the resource when a thread holds the write lock.

This approach is suitable when you have a system where reads are much more frequent than writes, as it allows high concurrency for read operations.

```java
ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
Lock readLock = lock.readLock();
Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

readLock.lock(); // multiple threads can acquire this lock
// Reading operations
readLock.unlock();

writeLock.lock(); // only one thread can acquire this lock at a time
// Writing operations
writeLock.unlock();
```

This significantly reduces lock contention in scenarios with heavy read operations and occasional writes.

---

### 334. **What is Lock striping?**

**Lock striping** is a technique used to reduce lock contention by partitioning data into several independent "stripes," each protected by its own lock. Instead of having a single lock for all data, multiple locks are distributed across different subsets of the data. Threads can acquire locks for different stripes concurrently, reducing contention and improving parallelism.

This technique is particularly useful when managing a large number of keys or items in a data structure like a map, where each lock only applies to a portion of the data.

**Example:**
In the context of a **ConcurrentHashMap**, multiple locks (or stripes) can be used to protect different segments of the map. Each segment (or stripe) has its own lock, allowing threads to work on different segments concurrently without waiting for the global lock.

```java
class LockStripingExample {
    private final ReentrantLock[] locks;

    public LockStripingExample(int numLocks) {
        locks = new ReentrantLock[numLocks];
        for (int i = 0; i < numLocks; i++) {
            locks[i] = new ReentrantLock();
        }
    }

    public void lock(int index) {
        locks[index % locks.length].lock();
    }

    public void unlock(int index) {
        locks[index % locks.length].unlock();
    }
}
```

By using lock striping, you improve the concurrency of the program by enabling multiple threads to work on different parts of the data concurrently.

---

### 335. **What is a CAS operation?**

**CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** is an atomic operation used in concurrent programming to ensure that a variable is only updated if it has not been modified by another thread since the last read. CAS is often used in **lock-free data structures** and is a fundamental concept in building concurrent applications without using locks.

The CAS operation works as follows:
- It takes three arguments: the **memory location** of the variable, the **expected value** (what the variable is expected to be), and the **new value** (what the variable should be updated to).
- It checks if the current value of the variable matches the expected value. If it does, the variable is updated to the new value. If not, the operation fails, and the thread must retry or handle the failure.

This technique is particularly useful in implementing **lock-free** algorithms and **atomic variables** like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`, etc.

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

// CAS Operation: if the current value of counter is 0, it will be updated to 1
boolean success = counter.compareAndSet(0, 1);
```

**Advantages of CAS:**
- It allows atomic updates to variables without needing locks, improving performance in multi-threaded environments.
- It reduces the overhead associated with locking mechanisms and can be used to build more efficient concurrent algorithms.

**Challenges:**
- **ABA Problem**: If the value changes and then changes back to the original value, CAS might not detect the change, causing an incorrect operation. Solutions like **versioning** or **marking** are used to overcome this issue.

CAS is widely used in **Java's `java.util.concurrent`** package, for example, in atomic classes (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicReference`, etc.).

### 336. **Which Java classes use CAS operation?**

In Java, several classes in the **`java.util.concurrent`** package utilize **Compare-And-Swap (CAS)** operations for efficient concurrency handling. These classes are designed to perform atomic operations without using traditional locking mechanisms. Some of the prominent classes that use CAS operations are:

1. **`AtomicInteger`**: This class provides methods like `compareAndSet(int expect, int update)` that use CAS to atomically update the value of an integer only if the current value is equal to the expected value.

2. **`AtomicLong`**: Similar to `AtomicInteger`, it provides atomic operations on a `long` type, using CAS under the hood.

3. **`AtomicReference<T>`**: This class allows atomic operations on object references. The `compareAndSet()` method compares the current reference with the expected reference and, if they are equal, updates it to the new reference.

4. **`AtomicBoolean`**: This is used for atomic boolean operations, where the `compareAndSet()` method atomically updates the value if it matches the expected value.

5. **`AtomicStampedReference<T>`**: This class maintains an object reference and an associated integer stamp. The CAS operation can compare both the reference and the stamp, which helps solve the ABA problem.

6. **`AtomicMarkableReference<T>`**: Similar to `AtomicStampedReference`, but it uses a boolean mark instead of a stamp for atomic operations.

7. **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: Specifically, the implementation of segments in `ConcurrentHashMap` uses CAS operations for thread-safe updates, especially when inserting or updating key-value pairs concurrently.

8. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**: This class uses CAS to ensure thread-safe updates to the internal array without needing locks. 

These classes use CAS to enable **lock-free programming** and are optimized for high concurrency, offering better performance in many cases compared to using synchronized blocks or methods.

### 337. **Is it always possible to improve performance by object pooling in a multi-threading application?**

No, **object pooling** does not always lead to performance improvement in a multi-threading application. While object pooling can be effective in some scenarios, it has limitations and may not be suitable in all cases. Here’s why:

#### When Object Pooling Helps:
1. **Expensive Object Creation**: Object pooling is useful when creating objects is resource-intensive or time-consuming. By reusing objects from the pool, the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying objects is reduced.
   
2. **Limited Resources**: If there are limited resources (such as database connections or thread pools), an object pool ensures that a fixed number of resources are used, helping to manage the availability and allocation of resources efficiently.

3. **Frequent Object Creation/Destruction**: When objects are frequently created and discarded (such as in database connections, threads, or network connections), pooling avoids the high cost of object creation and garbage collection.

#### When Object Pooling Might Not Help:
1. **Low Object Creation Cost**: If the objects are cheap to create and don’t involve expensive operations (like database or network calls), pooling can actually add overhead due to the complexity of managing the pool.

2. **Thread Contention**: Object pools may introduce thread contention when multiple threads attempt to access or borrow objects concurrently. This can negate the performance benefits if the pool management itself becomes a bottleneck.

3. **Memory Overhead**: The pool will hold onto objects, potentially consuming memory that could otherwise be freed up. This might increase memory consumption, especially if the number of objects in the pool is too large.

4. **Deadlock**: Improper management of pooled objects can lead to **deadlock** situations if the objects themselves are involved in locks or other synchronization mechanisms.

In conclusion, object pooling is not always a guaranteed performance improvement in multi-threaded applications. It should be used carefully when the cost of object creation is high, and proper management of the pool is necessary to avoid contention and deadlocks.

### 338. **How can techniques used for performance improvement in a single thread application degrade the performance in a multi-threading application?**

Some performance optimization techniques that work well in **single-threaded applications** can degrade performance in **multi-threaded applications** due to concurrency issues. Here are a few examples:

1. **Caching**: 
   - In single-threaded applications, caching can be a powerful optimization technique to avoid recalculating values or accessing slow resources.
   - However, in multi-threaded environments, improper use of caching can lead to **race conditions** and inconsistent states, as multiple threads might try to update the cache simultaneously. This can cause threads to read stale or inconsistent data.

2. **Optimizing for Locality of Reference**: 
   - In single-threaded applications, focusing on improving **locality of reference** (such as caching data in memory) can improve performance.
   - In multi-threaded applications, focusing too much on local optimization can hinder performance when multiple threads are competing for the same cache or memory resources, leading to **false sharing** (where threads inadvertently modify adjacent memory locations).

3. **Using Locks for Thread Safety**:
   - In single-threaded applications, you don’t need synchronization or locking, so you can focus on performance without worrying about thread safety.
   - In multi-threaded applications, excessive use of locks (especially global locks) can lead to **deadlocks**, **contention**, and **latency** as threads compete for access to shared resources. Additionally, **lock contention** can significantly degrade performance if not managed properly.

4. **Minimizing Memory Usage**:
   - In single-threaded applications, you can be more aggressive in minimizing memory consumption, as only one thread is using the memory.
   - In multi-threaded applications, trying to reduce memory usage too aggressively can lead to increased **garbage collection (GC)** pressure or **memory contention**, which can degrade performance. For example, memory-intensive tasks can cause frequent GC cycles, impacting thread execution.

5. **Reducing Function Calls**:
   - Single-threaded performance can benefit from **inlining functions** or reducing the number of function calls.
   - In multi-threaded applications, reducing function calls might lead to **tight coupling** between threads, making it harder to isolate them and manage parallelism effectively. Excessive inlining can also cause code duplication, leading to **larger binary sizes** and inefficient use of CPU caches.

6. **Aggressive Optimization for Speed**:
   - In single-threaded applications, focusing solely on speed (e.g., using **low-level optimizations**) can lead to better performance.
   - In multi-threaded applications, such optimizations may interfere with **synchronization** and **thread coordination**, resulting in **thread starvation** or **race conditions**, which can degrade overall performance.

Thus, it is essential to consider the multi-threading environment's complexities and avoid blindly applying single-thread optimization techniques in a multi-threaded context.

### 339. **What is the relation between Executor and ExecutorService interface?**

The **`Executor`** and **`ExecutorService`** interfaces in Java are part of the **java.util.concurrent** package and play a key role in simplifying the management of concurrent tasks. Here’s the relation between them:

1. **`Executor` Interface**:
   - The `Executor` interface is a simple interface with a single method:
     ```java
     void execute(Runnable command);
     ```
   - It provides a mechanism to submit tasks for execution without having to manage threads manually. It decouples task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be executed, such as using threads, thread pools, or other mechanisms.
   - The `Executor` interface doesn't provide any way to manage the lifecycle of tasks (such as shutting down or awaiting termination).

2. **`ExecutorService` Interface**:
   - `ExecutorService` extends the `Executor` interface and adds more methods for managing and controlling task execution, including the ability to manage the lifecycle of tasks and the executor itself.
   - Some of the key methods in `ExecutorService` include:
     - `submit()`: Accepts a `Runnable` or `Callable` and returns a `Future`, allowing for tracking the completion or result of the task.
     - `shutdown()`: Initiates an orderly shutdown of the executor service.
     - `invokeAll()`, `invokeAny()`: Allow you to execute multiple tasks concurrently and collect their results.
     - `isShutdown()`, `isTerminated()`: Methods to check the status of the executor.

   - Essentially, **`ExecutorService`** is an extended version of **`Executor`** that provides more features for managing concurrency, handling tasks asynchronously, and ensuring orderly shutdown.

#### Summary:
- **`Executor`** is a simpler interface that only has the `execute()` method to execute tasks.
- **`ExecutorService`** extends `Executor` and provides methods for task management, scheduling, and shutting down.

For example:
```java
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.execute(() -> { System.out.println("Task executed!"); });

ExecutorService executorService = (ExecutorService) executor;
executorService.shutdown();  // Now we can shutdown the executor service gracefully
```

### 340. **What will happen on calling submit() method of an ExecutorService instance whose queue is already full?**

When you call the `submit()` method of an **`ExecutorService`** and the queue is already full, the behavior depends on the type of **`ExecutorService`** being used. For example:

- If you are using a **fixed thread pool** (e.g., `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`), the queue (backlog) is used to hold tasks that are waiting for execution. If the queue becomes full and no threads are available to execute the new task, the task will typically be rejected.
  
  In such cases, the default behavior of **`ThreadPoolExecutor`** (which backs the `ExecutorService`) depends on the **rejection policy**. The most common rejection policies are:
  - **`AbortPolicy`** (default): This throws a `RejectedExecutionException` if the task cannot be accepted.
  - **`CallerRunsPolicy`**: The task will be executed in the thread that submitted the task (instead of a worker thread).
  - **`DiscardPolicy`**: The task is simply discarded.
  - **`DiscardOldestPolicy`**: The oldest unhandled request is discarded, and the current task is attempted to be executed.

To prevent this issue, you can either increase the size of the thread pool, increase the capacity of the queue, or use a different rejection policy, depending on your application's requirements.

### 341. **What is a ScheduledExecutorService?**

`ScheduledExecutorService` is an extension of the `ExecutorService` interface, specifically designed for scheduling tasks with fixed-rate or fixed-delay execution policies. It allows you to schedule tasks with various time intervals, both periodically and at fixed times.

Key methods of `ScheduledExecutorService`:
1. **`schedule()`**: Schedules a one-time task after a given delay.
   ```java
   ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
   scheduler.schedule(() -> System.out.println("Task executed!"), 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
   ```
2. **`scheduleAtFixedRate()`**: Schedules a recurring task at a fixed-rate interval, starting from the first execution time.
   ```java
   scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> System.out.println("Task executed!"), 0, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
   ```
3. **`scheduleWithFixedDelay()`**: Schedules a recurring task with a fixed delay between the end of one execution and the start of the next.
   ```java
   scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> System.out.println("Task executed!"), 0, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
   ```

It is mainly used for tasks that need to be executed at regular intervals or after a delay, like background maintenance tasks.

### 342. **How will you create a Thread pool in Java?**

In Java, you can create a thread pool using the **`ExecutorService`** interface, with various factory methods available in the **`Executors`** class. 

The most common thread pool types are:
- **Fixed Thread Pool**: A pool with a fixed number of threads.
- **Cached Thread Pool**: A pool that creates new threads as needed but reuses previously constructed threads when available.
- **Single Thread Pool**: A pool that has only one thread to execute tasks.
- **Scheduled Thread Pool**: A pool for scheduling tasks with delays or fixed-rate executions.

Examples:
1. **Fixed Thread Pool**:
   ```java
   ExecutorService fixedThreadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
   ```
2. **Cached Thread Pool**:
   ```java
   ExecutorService cachedThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
   ```
3. **Single Thread Pool**:
   ```java
   ExecutorService singleThreadPool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
   ```
4. **Scheduled Thread Pool**:
   ```java
   ScheduledExecutorService scheduledThreadPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);
   ```

Each of these pools can be used to submit tasks (`Runnable` or `Callable`) for execution in a managed, efficient manner.

### 343. **What is the main difference between Runnable and Callable interface?**

The **`Runnable`** and **`Callable`** interfaces are both used for representing tasks that can be executed by multiple threads, but they have key differences:

- **Return Value**:
  - **`Runnable`**: It does not return any result. Its `run()` method has a `void` return type.
  - **`Callable`**: It returns a result. Its `call()` method returns a value of type `V`, and it may also throw an exception.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - **`Runnable`**: Cannot throw checked exceptions, as the `run()` method doesn't allow exceptions (except for unchecked exceptions).
  - **`Callable`**: Can throw checked exceptions, making it more flexible for tasks that need exception handling.

- **Usage**:
  - **`Runnable`**: Used when the task doesn't need to return any result or handle checked exceptions.
  - **`Callable`**: Used when the task needs to return a result or potentially throw exceptions.

Example of **`Runnable`**:
```java
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task is running!");
new Thread(task).start();
```

Example of **`Callable`**:
```java
Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
    return 42;
};
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);
System.out.println("Result: " + result.get());
```

### 344. **What are the uses of Future interface in Java?**

The **`Future`** interface in Java represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows you to track the progress and retrieve the result of a task that is executed asynchronously, usually by an **`ExecutorService`**.

Key uses of `Future` include:
1. **Retrieve Results**: You can use `Future.get()` to obtain the result of the task, blocking until the result is available (or the task completes).
   ```java
   Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(callableTask);
   Integer value = result.get();  // blocks until the result is available
   ```

2. **Check if a Task is Complete**: `Future.isDone()` can be used to check if the task has completed.
   ```java
   if (result.isDone()) {
       System.out.println("Task is done!");
   }
   ```

3. **Cancel the Task**: You can cancel the execution of the task using `Future.cancel()`. If the task hasn't started or is in a cancellable state, it will be canceled.
   ```java
   boolean success = result.cancel(true);  // attempt to cancel the task
   ```

4. **Timeout Handling**: The `get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method allows you to specify a maximum time to wait for the task to complete. If the task doesn't finish within the specified time, a `TimeoutException` is thrown.
   ```java
   try {
       Integer value = result.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  // waits for max 10 seconds
   } catch (TimeoutException e) {
       System.out.println("Task timed out!");
   }
   ```

5. **Handling Exceptions**: If a task fails or throws an exception, you can retrieve the exception via `Future.get()`.
   ```java
   try {
       result.get();  // may throw ExecutionException if the task fails
   } catch (ExecutionException e) {
       System.out.println("Task failed with exception: " + e.getCause());
   }
   ```

The `Future` interface is a key part of managing asynchronous tasks, providing methods for handling task results, cancellations, and timeouts.

### 345. **What is the difference in concurrency in HashMap and in Hashtable?**

The primary differences in terms of concurrency between **`HashMap`** and **`Hashtable`** are:

1. **Thread Safety**:
   - **`Hashtable`**: It is **synchronized** by default, meaning it is thread-safe. Multiple threads can safely access and modify the `Hashtable` simultaneously.
   - **`HashMap`**: It is **not synchronized**, making it not thread-safe by default. Multiple threads accessing a `HashMap` simultaneously without external synchronization can lead to inconsistent or corrupt data.

2. **Performance**:
   - **`Hashtable`**: The synchronization of `Hashtable` results in performance overhead, especially when multiple threads are accessing it concurrently, as it locks the entire map for each operation.
   - **`HashMap`**: Since it is not synchronized, it generally offers better performance in single-threaded or external synchronization scenarios, where thread-safety is managed externally.

3. **Null Keys and Values**:
   - **`Hashtable`**: It does not allow `null` keys or `null` values. Attempting to insert `null` will throw a `NullPointerException`.
   - **`HashMap`**: It allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.

4. **Usage**:
   - **`Hashtable`**: Due to its synchronization and older design, it is less commonly used in modern Java applications. It has been mostly replaced by `HashMap` in most cases.
   - **`HashMap`**: It is the preferred choice for most applications requiring a key-value map. If thread safety is needed, external synchronization (e.g., using `Collections.synchronizedMap()` or `ConcurrentHashMap`) is recommended.

### 346. **How will you create a synchronized instance of List or Map Collection?**

To create a synchronized version of a **`List`** or **`Map`** collection in Java, you can use the **`Collections.synchronizedList()`** or **`Collections.synchronizedMap()`** methods, which wrap the original collection in a synchronized wrapper.

- **Synchronized List**:
  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  List<String> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(list);
  ```

- **Synchronized Map**:
  ```java
  Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
  Map<String, String> synchronizedMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(map);
  ```

These collections will ensure that all operations on the list or map are synchronized, meaning only one thread can access the collection at a time. However, it's important to note that you must manually synchronize on the collection when iterating through it:

```java
synchronized (synchronizedList) {
    for (String item : synchronizedList) {
        // Iterate safely
    }
}
```

### 347. **What is a Semaphore in Java?**

A **`Semaphore`** is a synchronization aid that allows controlling access to a shared resource in a concurrent environment. It maintains a set of permits, and threads can acquire and release permits to control access to resources.

- **`acquire()`**: A thread tries to acquire a permit. If no permit is available, the thread is blocked until one becomes available.
- **`release()`**: A thread releases a permit, allowing another thread to acquire it.

A **`Semaphore`** is useful for controlling access to a limited number of resources, such as a connection pool or a set of file handlers.

Example:
```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // 3 permits
// Acquiring a permit
semaphore.acquire();
// Releasing a permit
semaphore.release();
```

### 348. **What is a CountDownLatch in Java?**

A **`CountDownLatch`** is a synchronization utility that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations (usually in other threads) are completed. It maintains an internal counter, and threads can call **`await()`** to wait until the counter reaches zero.

The counter is decremented each time the **`countDown()`** method is called. When the counter reaches zero, all threads waiting on the latch are released.

Example:
```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // Waiting for 3 threads
// Thread 1
new Thread(() -> {
    // Do some work
    latch.countDown(); // Decrease count
}).start();
// Other threads...
latch.await(); // Main thread waits until count reaches zero
```

`CountDownLatch` is useful for scenarios where multiple threads must complete their work before the main thread can proceed, such as in parallel data processing or initialization tasks.

### 349. **What is the difference between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier?**

Both **`CountDownLatch`** and **`CyclicBarrier`** are used for synchronizing threads, but they have key differences in their behavior and use cases:

1. **Reusability**:
   - **`CountDownLatch`**: Once the counter reaches zero, the latch cannot be reset. It is a one-time use synchronization mechanism. Once all threads have completed and the latch is released, it cannot be reused.
   - **`CyclicBarrier`**: It can be reused. After the waiting threads are released, the barrier can be reset, allowing it to be used again in subsequent phases of a task.

2. **Usage**:
   - **`CountDownLatch`**: It is typically used when one or more threads need to wait for other threads to complete their execution before continuing. It’s often used when you have a fixed number of tasks that need to complete before proceeding.
   - **`CyclicBarrier`**: It is used when you need to synchronize threads at a common point repeatedly. It’s often used in situations where multiple threads perform phases of work and need to synchronize after each phase.

3. **Number of parties**:
   - **`CountDownLatch`**: It is initialized with a count that represents the number of events or threads to wait for.
   - **`CyclicBarrier`**: It is initialized with the number of threads (parties) that must arrive at the barrier before they can all proceed.

Example of **`CyclicBarrier`**:
```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> {
    System.out.println("All threads have arrived at the barrier, proceeding...");
});
new Thread(() -> {
    // Do some work
    barrier.await();
}).start();
```

### Summary of Differences:
- **CountDownLatch** is a one-time synchronization barrier used for waiting for a certain number of events to complete.
- **CyclicBarrier** is a reusable synchronization barrier, often used when multiple threads need to be synchronized in repeated cycles.

### 350. **What are the scenarios suitable for using Fork/Join framework?**

The **Fork/Join Framework** in Java is designed for parallel processing tasks that can be broken down into smaller subtasks, which can be processed concurrently. It is especially useful in situations where:

1. **Divide and Conquer Problem**: Tasks that can be split into smaller sub-tasks, each of which can be processed independently and later combined (reduced) to give the final result. For example:
   - Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Matrix multiplication
   - Recursive algorithms (like searching or traversing large datasets)
   
2. **Task Parallelism**: Scenarios where there are independent tasks that can be executed concurrently, and their results need to be merged later. For example, processing large files in parallel, or handling large-scale data processing.

3. **Workload Distribution**: Tasks that are CPU-bound and need to be executed in parallel to make efficient use of multiple processor cores.

The Fork/Join framework allows for **recursive decomposition**, where each task is divided into smaller tasks (forked) until the task is small enough to be directly computed, and then the results are combined (joined).

Example of use:
```java
ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = new ForkJoinPool();
ForkJoinTask<Integer> task = new RecursiveTask<Integer>() {
    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (task is small enough) {
            return computeDirectly();
        } else {
            ForkJoinTask<Integer> task1 = forkSubtask();
            ForkJoinTask<Integer> task2 = forkSubtask();
            task1.fork();
            task2.fork();
            return task1.join() + task2.join(); // Joining results
        }
    }
};
forkJoinPool.submit(task);
```

### 351. **What is the difference between RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction class?**

Both **`RecursiveTask`** and **`RecursiveAction`** are part of the **Fork/Join Framework** in Java. The primary difference between them is related to whether the task returns a result:

- **`RecursiveTask<T>`**:
  - A **`RecursiveTask`** is used when the task **returns a result**.
  - It is typically used when the computation produces a value that must be returned.
  - The `compute()` method in `RecursiveTask` should return the computed result.
  
  Example:
  ```java
  public class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
      private final int[] data;
      private final int start;
      private final int end;
  
      public SumTask(int[] data, int start, int end) {
          this.data = data;
          this.start = start;
          this.end = end;
      }
  
      @Override
      protected Integer compute() {
          if (end - start <= 10) {  // Base case
              int sum = 0;
              for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                  sum += data[i];
              }
              return sum;
          } else {  // Split task into subtasks
              int mid = (start + end) / 2;
              SumTask leftTask = new SumTask(data, start, mid);
              SumTask rightTask = new SumTask(data, mid, end);
              leftTask.fork();
              rightTask.fork();
              return leftTask.join() + rightTask.join();  // Combine results
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **`RecursiveAction`**:
  - A **`RecursiveAction`** is used when the task **does not return a result**.
  - It is typically used when the computation does not produce a return value but rather performs some side-effect (e.g., modifying shared data or performing operations without returning a value).
  
  Example:
  ```java
  public class PrintTask extends RecursiveAction {
      private final int[] data;
      private final int start;
      private final int end;
  
      public PrintTask(int[] data, int start, int end) {
          this.data = data;
          this.start = start;
          this.end = end;
      }
  
      @Override
      protected void compute() {
          if (end - start <= 10) {  // Base case
              for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                  System.out.println(data[i]);
              }
          } else {  // Split task into subtasks
              int mid = (start + end) / 2;
              PrintTask leftTask = new PrintTask(data, start, mid);
              PrintTask rightTask = new PrintTask(data, mid, end);
              leftTask.fork();
              rightTask.fork();
              leftTask.join();
              rightTask.join();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 352. **In Java 8, can we process stream operations with a Thread pool?**

Yes, in **Java 8**, you can process stream operations using a **Thread pool** by utilizing **parallel streams**. Parallel streams in Java are backed by the **ForkJoinPool** (by default), but you can customize it to use a different thread pool if necessary.

- **Parallel Stream**: When you invoke the `parallel()` method on a stream, it processes the stream operations in parallel using multiple threads from the ForkJoinPool (default thread pool for parallel streams). 

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
numbers.parallelStream()
       .forEach(System.out::println); // Process elements in parallel
```

- **Custom Thread Pool**: You can use a custom thread pool with parallel streams by specifying a custom `ExecutorService` and configuring it with `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` or other configurations.

For example, to use a custom **ExecutorService** with a stream:
```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = new ForkJoinPool(4); // Use custom ForkJoinPool

// Custom parallel stream processing
numbers.parallelStream()
       .forEachAsync(executorService, System.out::println);
```

In this case, the default parallel stream behavior will be overridden by your custom thread pool.

### 353. **What are the scenarios to use parallel stream in Java 8?**

Parallel streams in Java 8 are useful when:

1. **CPU-bound tasks**: If the tasks are computationally intensive (CPU-bound), parallel streams can significantly improve performance by dividing the work across multiple cores. For example, performing operations like filtering, mapping, or reducing on large datasets.

2. **Independent operations**: The tasks in a stream should be independent (i.e., the results of one task should not depend on the results of others). This allows the parallel streams to execute tasks concurrently without synchronization issues.

3. **Large datasets**: Parallel streams can help speed up operations on large collections by distributing the workload across available CPU cores. It is especially effective for large data processing or batch processing.

4. **Data transformations**: When you need to perform multiple transformations or aggregations on large datasets, parallel streams can help speed up the execution by parallelizing operations such as filtering, mapping, or reducing.

However, parallel streams should be used carefully because:
- **Small datasets**: For small datasets, the overhead of parallelization may outweigh the benefits, making a regular stream faster.
- **Non-CPU-bound tasks**: For tasks that are I/O bound or involve waiting for external resources (like database access or file I/O), parallel streams may not provide significant performance benefits.
- **Shared state**: If the stream operations involve modifying shared state (non-thread-safe objects), you might encounter synchronization issues, and parallel streams may not be a good choice.

### 354. **How Stack and Heap work in Java multi-threading environment?**

In Java, **Stack** and **Heap** memory are used differently for multi-threaded operations:

1. **Stack Memory**:
   - Each thread in Java has its own **stack**, which stores **local variables**, method calls, and function call frames.
   - Each time a method is invoked, a new **stack frame** is created in the thread's stack. When the method returns, the frame is popped from the stack.
   - Since each thread has its own stack, there is no risk of **thread interference** or **concurrency issues** related to stack variables.
   - **Stack memory** is used for storing primitive data types (like `int`, `char`, etc.) and references to objects (not the objects themselves).
   - The stack is **thread-local**, meaning each thread has its own stack.

2. **Heap Memory**:
   - The **heap** is a shared memory area where **objects** are allocated. All objects created in Java (including arrays) are stored in the heap, regardless of which thread creates them.
   - Since heap memory is shared among all threads, concurrent access to objects in the heap must be properly synchronized to avoid **thread interference** or **data inconsistency**.
   - Java provides **garbage collection** in the heap to manage memory by automatically reclaiming unused memory. However, **synchronization** is needed when multiple threads access or modify the same object in the heap.

In summary, **stack memory** is thread-local and private to each thread, while **heap memory** is shared among all threads and requires synchronization for safe concurrent access.

### 355. **How can we take Thread dump in Java?**

A **thread dump** provides information about the state of all threads in a Java application, which helps diagnose performance issues, deadlocks, or thread contention problems.

To take a **thread dump** in Java, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Using `jstack` tool**:
   - The `jstack` command is part of the JDK and can be used to obtain thread dumps from a running JVM process.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     jstack <pid> > thread_dump.txt
     ```
     Where `<pid>` is the Process ID of the Java application. This will output the thread dump to the file `thread_dump.txt`.

2. **Using `Ctrl + Break` on Windows**:
   - In a command-line terminal (for Windows), press **Ctrl + Break** to trigger a thread dump.

3. **Using `kill` command on Unix/Linux**:
   - On a Unix/Linux system, you can send a **`QUIT` signal** to a running Java process to obtain a thread dump.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     kill -3 <pid>
     ```
     The thread dump will be printed to the console or log files depending on the JVM configuration.

4. **Using `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` in code**:
   - You can get the current stack traces of all live threads using `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` programmatically.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Map<Thread, StackTraceElement[]> threadDump = Thread.getAllStackTraces();
     for (Map.Entry<Thread, StackTraceElement[]> entry : threadDump.entrySet()) {
         System.out.println(entry.getKey());
         for (StackTraceElement ste : entry.getValue()) {
             System.out.println(ste);
         }
     }
     ```

### 356. **Which parameter can be used to control stack size of a thread in Java?**

You can control the **stack size** of a thread in Java using the `-Xss` JVM option.

- The `-Xss` option specifies the size of the **stack** for each thread.
- This can be useful when you need to manage memory usage, especially for recursive algorithms, or when a program creates many threads.

Example:
```bash
java -Xss512k MyApp
```
This sets the stack size of each thread to **512 KB**.

### 357. **There are two threads T1 and T2. How will you ensure that these threads run in sequence T1, T2 in Java?**

To ensure that **T1** runs before **T2** in Java, you can use synchronization techniques like `join()`, `wait()`, and `notify()`, or use a higher-level concurrency mechanism like **ExecutorService**.

Here are a few ways to ensure T1 runs before T2:

1. **Using `Thread.join()`**:
   - The `join()` method can be used to make sure **T2** starts only after **T1** finishes its execution. By calling `T1.join()` before starting **T2**, you ensure that **T2** will wait for **T1** to complete.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
       }
   }

   public class ThreadExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           MyThread T1 = new MyThread();
           MyThread T2 = new MyThread();

           T1.start();   // Start T1
           T1.join();    // Wait for T1 to finish before starting T2
           T2.start();   // Start T2
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, **T2** will not start until **T1** finishes.

2. **Using `CountDownLatch`**:
   - You can use a `CountDownLatch` to ensure that **T2** only starts after **T1** completes. A `CountDownLatch` is initialized with a count, and when the count reaches zero, other threads can proceed.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

   public class ThreadExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
           CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);

           Thread T1 = new Thread(() -> {
               System.out.println("T1 is running");
               latch.countDown();  // Signal that T1 is finished
           });

           Thread T2 = new Thread(() -> {
               try {
                   latch.await();  // Wait for T1 to finish
                   System.out.println("T2 is running");
               } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                   Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
               }
           });

           T1.start();
           T2.start();
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, **T2** will wait until **T1** calls `latch.countDown()`, ensuring **T1** runs before **T2**.

3. **Using `ExecutorService` with proper task ordering**:
   - If you are using `ExecutorService` to manage threads, you can submit the tasks in the required order (T1 before T2).
   
   Example:
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
   import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

   public class ThreadExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

           executor.submit(() -> {
               System.out.println("T1 is running");
           });

           executor.submit(() -> {
               System.out.println("T2 is running");
           });

           executor.shutdown();
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, although both tasks are submitted to the executor, the execution order is based on how the tasks are scheduled by the executor.

In conclusion, the simplest way to ensure that **T1** runs before **T2** is by using the `join()` method, but other techniques like `CountDownLatch` or task scheduling in `ExecutorService` can be used depending on your specific use case.
