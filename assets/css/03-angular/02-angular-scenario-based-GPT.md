### **Angular – Practical / Situation-Based / Real-World Questions**

1. You need to load data from an API and display it in a component. How do you handle the asynchronous call and errors?

2. How would you optimize performance for a component that renders a **large list of items**?

3. You have a form with multiple steps and validations. How do you manage the form state across steps?

4. A child component needs to communicate with a deeply nested parent component. How do you handle this in Angular?

5. How do you implement **conditional rendering** for loading, error, and success states in Angular templates?

6. Your Angular app is slow due to frequent change detection cycles. How do you optimize it?

7. You have a service that provides shared data across multiple components. How do you ensure it stays updated correctly?

8. How would you handle **lazy loading** of modules to improve app startup time?

9. How do you implement authentication with JWT in an Angular application?

10. How do you decide when to use **Reactive Forms vs Template-Driven Forms** in Angular?

11. How would you handle **debouncing or throttling** user input (e.g., search box) to avoid excessive API calls?

12. Your component needs to subscribe to multiple Observables and perform actions when all emit data. How do you manage it?

13. How would you implement **role-based access control** in Angular routes and components?

14. A third-party library directly manipulates the DOM. How do you safely integrate it with Angular?

15. How do you prevent memory leaks when subscribing to Observables in components?

16. How do you implement **dynamic forms** where fields change based on previous user input?

17. You need to handle **global error handling** for HTTP requests in your Angular app. How do you do it?

18. How do you manage **state across multiple unrelated components** in Angular?

19. Your app has several frequently updated UI elements. How do you **optimize change detection** to avoid unnecessary re-renders?

20. How would you **migrate a large AngularJS application to Angular** while minimizing downtime and errors?
