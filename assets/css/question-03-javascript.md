Here are 60 common JavaScript interview questions for beginners, along with their answers:

### 1. **What is JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive web pages. It runs in the browser and allows developers to manipulate web page content and respond to user events.

### 2. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
   **Answer:**
   - `var`: Function-scoped or globally scoped; can be redeclared and updated.
   - `let`: Block-scoped; can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope.
   - `const`: Block-scoped; cannot be updated or redeclared after initialization.

### 3. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

### 4. **What is a callback function?**
   **Answer:** A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of an operation, often asynchronously.

### 5. **What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?**
   **Answer:** An IIFE is a function expression that is executed immediately after being defined, usually wrapped in parentheses.

   ```javascript
   (function() {
       console.log("I am executed!");
   })();
   ```

### 6. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
   **Answer:**
   - `==` compares values for equality, performing type coercion if needed.
   - `===` compares both value and type, without coercion.

### 7. **What is an object in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be any data type, including functions.

   ```javascript
   let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   ```

### 8. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword?**
   **Answer:** The `this` keyword refers to the object from which the function was called. Its value is determined by the context in which it is used.

### 9. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

### 10. **What is event delegation?**
   **Answer:** Event delegation is a technique in which a single event listener is attached to a parent element to handle events on child elements, reducing the need to attach multiple listeners.

### 11. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
   **Answer:**
   - `null`: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
   - `undefined`: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

### 12. **What are JavaScript data types?**
   **Answer:** JavaScript has 7 primitive data types: `String`, `Number`, `BigInt`, `Boolean`, `undefined`, `Symbol`, and `null`. It also has one non-primitive type: `Object`.

### 13. **What is a promise in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### 14. **What are async and await?**
   **Answer:**
   - `async`: Declares a function that will return a promise.
   - `await`: Pauses the execution of an `async` function until the promise is resolved.

### 15. **What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()`?**
   **Answer:**
   - `slice()`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
   - `splice()`: Changes the content of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.

### 16. **What is the `bind()` method in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to a specific object, and can have pre-set arguments.

### 17. **What is a prototype in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** A prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object in JavaScript. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from another object.

### 18. **What is the difference between `forEach` and `map`?**
   **Answer:**
   - `forEach`: Iterates over an array and executes a function for each element; does not return a value.
   - `map`: Iterates over an array, applies a function to each element, and returns a new array of results.

### 19. **What is the `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** `setTimeout()` is used to execute a function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

   ```javascript
   setTimeout(function() {
       console.log("Hello");
   }, 1000); // Executes after 1 second
   ```

### 20. **What is the `setInterval()` function in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** `setInterval()` is used to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).

   ```javascript
   setInterval(function() {
       console.log("Hello");
   }, 1000); // Executes every 1 second
   ```

### 21. **What is a "call stack"?**
   **Answer:** The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in JavaScript. When a function is called, it is added to the stack; once it finishes, it is removed from the stack.

### 22. **What is the `new` keyword in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** The `new` keyword is used to create an instance of an object that is based on a constructor function or class.

### 23. **What is JSON and how is it used?**
   **Answer:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for representing structured data. It can be used to transfer data between a server and a web application.

   ```javascript
   let json = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
   let obj = JSON.parse(json);
   ```

### 24. **What is the difference between `function` and `arrow function` in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:**
   - `function`: Can be called using `this`, which depends on the context of where it is called.
   - `arrow function`: Does not have its own `this` context and inherits `this` from its surrounding lexical scope.

### 25. **What is the `typeof` operator?**
   **Answer:** The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of a variable or expression.

   ```javascript
   typeof "Hello"; // "string"
   typeof 5; // "number"
   ```

### 26. **What is the `instanceof` operator?**
   **Answer:** The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object is an instance of a specified class or constructor function.

   ```javascript
   let date = new Date();
   console.log(date instanceof Date); // true
   ```

### 27. **What are template literals in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** Template literals are a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using backticks (`` ` ``) and `${}` syntax.

   ```javascript
   let name = "John";
   let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

### 28. **What is the difference between `var` and `let`?**
   **Answer:** `var` is function-scoped or globally scoped and can be redeclared, whereas `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared within the same block.

### 29. **What is the difference between `null` and an empty string `""`?**
   **Answer:** 
   - `null`: Represents no value or object.
   - `""`: Represents an empty string, which is a string type with no characters.

### 30. **What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?**
   **Answer:** Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

### 31. **What is the `for...in` loop in JavaScript?**

### 5. **What is a closure?**
**Answer**: A closure is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. It allows access to variables from the outer function even after the outer function has finished execution.

### 6. **What are functions in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can be declared using the `function` keyword or created as arrow functions.

### 7. **What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?**
**Answer**:
- **Function Declaration**: A function declared with the `function` keyword that is hoisted.
  ```javascript
  function greet() {}
  ```
- **Function Expression**: A function assigned to a variable, and it is not hoisted.
  ```javascript
  const greet = function() {};
  ```

### 8. **What are arrow functions?**
**Answer**: Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They don't have their own `this`, they inherit it from the surrounding context.
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
