## JavaScript output based interview questions 

**1. What will be the output**
```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6, 7];
arr.length = 0;
console.log(arr);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : [ ]</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The length of the array has been set to 0, so the array becomes empty.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**2. What will be the output**
```js
x = 10;
console.log(x);
var x;
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 10</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The declaration of the variable x is hoisted to the top of its scope.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**3. What will be the output**
```js
let a = { x: 1, y: 2 }
let b = a;
b.x = 3;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : { x: 3, y: 2 } { x: 3, y: 2 }</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : 'a' and 'b' both are pointing to the same reference.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**4. What will be the output**
```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log("value is " + i);
  })
}
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 10 times, "value is 10"</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : "var" has a function scope, and there will be only one shared binding for the iterations. By the time the setTimeout function gets executed, the for loop has already completed and the value of the variable i is 10.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**5. What will be the output**
```js
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log("value is " + i);
  })
}
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 10 times "value is" followed by the value of i in each iteration, from 0 to 9</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : "let" has a block scope, and a new binding will be created for each iteration. Here, a new variable i is created and has a different value for each iteration of the loop.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**6. What will be the output**
```js
function hello() {
  console.log("1");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("2");
    })
  console.log("3");
}
hello();
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : "1" followed by "3", and then after a small delay, "2"</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : console.log("1") statement logs "1" to the console. Then setTimeout() function is set to execute the callback function in the next event loop iteration and logs "3" to the console.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**7. What will be the output**
```js
let f = "8";
let a = 1;
console.log((+f)+a+1);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 10</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The expression (+f) is a shorthand way to convert the string value of f to a number. Therefore, (+f) evaluates to 8.</li>
</ul>
</details> 

**[:top: Scroll to Top](#javascript-output-based-interview-questions)**

**8. What will be the output**
```js
let a = 10;
if(true){
   let a = 20;
   console.log(a, "inside");
}
console.log(a, "outside");
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 20, "inside" and 10, "outside"</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The variable "a" declared inside "if" has block scope and does not affect the value of the outer "a" variable.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**9. What will be the output**
```js
var a = "xyz";
var a = "pqr";
console.log(a)
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : "pqr"</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : Both the variables are declared using "var" keyword with the same name "a". The second variable declaration will override the first variable declaration.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**10. What will be the output**
```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = [6, 7, 5];
const result = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(result);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5]</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : Spread operator (...) concatenates the two arrays into "result" array.</li>
</ul>

const person2 = { city: 'abc', ...person1 };
console.log(person2);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : { city: 'abc', name: 'xyz', age: 21 }</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : Spread operator (...) copies all the properties from person1 into person2.</li>
</ul>

**12. What will be the output**
```js
console.log(5 < 6 < 7);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : true</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : In JavaScript, the < operator evaluates expressions from left to right. First, the expression 5 < 6 is evaluated, resulting in true because 5 is less than 6. Then, the expression true < 7 is evaluated. In this case, JavaScript performs type coercion and converts true to the number 1. Therefore, the expression becomes 1 < 7, which is true.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**13. What will be the output**
```js
console.log(7 > 6 > 5);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : false</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : In JavaScript, the > operator evaluates expressions from left to right. First, the expression 7 > 6 is evaluated, resulting in true because 7 is greater than 6. Then, the expression true > 5 is evaluated. In this case, JavaScript performs type coercion and converts true to the number 1. Therefore, the expression becomes 1 > 5, which is false.</li>
</ul>

**14. What will be the output**
```js
console.log(0 == false);
console.log(1 == true);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : true, true</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The == operator converts operands to a common type before making the comparison. In both the cases, the boolean value will be converted to a number, i.e., false is converted to 0 and true is converted to 1. So, the expression 0 == false is equivalent to 0 == 0 and 1 == true is equivalent to 1 == 1.</li>
</ul>
</details>

**15. What will be the output**
```js
console.log([11, 2, 31] + [4, 5, 6]);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : "11,2,314,5,6"</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When you try to concatenate two arrays using the + operator, the arrays are converted to strings and then concatenated together. In this case, the arrays [11, 2, 31] and [4, 5, 6] are converted to strings as "11,2,31" and "4,5,6" respectively. Then, the two strings are concatenated, resulting in "11,2,314,5,6".</li>
</ul>

**16. What will be the output**
```js
console.log({} == {}); 
console.log({} === {});
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : false, false</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : When you compare objects using == or ===, it checks if they refer to the exact same object. So even if they are looking same, they are pointing to different memory locations.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 5, 6</li>
	<li><b>Reason</b> : The post-increment operator increments and returns the value before incrementing.</li>
</ul>

```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 2</li>

```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : [ 30, 40 ]</li>

<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 25</li>

**28. What will be the output (shallow copy of an object)**
```js
const userDetails = {
  firstName: "Surbhi",
  lastName: "Dighe",
  age: 20,
  address: {
    city: "Hyderabad",
    country: "India",
  },

let cloneUserDetails = { ...userDetails };
//Updating original object
userDetails.age = 22;
userDetails.address.city = "Banglore";

console.log(cloneUserDetails.age); 
console.log(cloneUserDetails.address.city);
```
<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : 20, "Banglore"</li>
	<li><b>Reason </b> : cloneUserDetails is created by using the spread syntax ({ ...userDetails }). This syntax creates a shallow copy of the userDetails object, meaning that the top-level properties are copied, but nested objects are still referenced.</li>
	<li><b>case 1</b> : Although userDetails.age was changed to 22, cloneUserDetails still holds the original value of 20. This is because the spread syntax only creates a shallow copy, so the age property of cloneUserDetails remains unchanged.</li>
	<li><b>case 2</b> : The nested address object is still referenced by cloneUserDetails, so when the city property of userDetails.address is changed, it reflects in cloneUserDetails.address as well. Therefore, the output is "Banglore".</li>

<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : undefined, ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'age' before initialization"</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(name)</b> : The variable name (declared with var) is hoisted to the top, so JavaScript knows it exists, but it hasn't been assigned a value yet, so it prints undefined</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(age)</b> : The variable age (declared with let) is also hoisted to the top of its scope, but unlike var, it is not initialized until the line where it is declared.</b></li>

	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : true, false</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(arr1 == str)</b> : Javascript compiler performs type conversion. In this case, it converts the array arr1 and the string str to their string representations and then compares them.</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(arr1==arr2) </b> : In Javascript arrays are objects and objects are compared by reference. In this case, arr1 and arr2 are pointing to 2 different memory locations</b></li>

<details>
	<summary><b>View Answer</b></summary>
<ul>	
	<li><b>Output</b> : false, true</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(a === b)</b> : This compares whether a and b refer to the exact same object in memory. They are two different objects in memory, so the comparison evaluates to false</li>
	<li><b>Reason for console.log(a.x === b.x)</b> : This compares the x property of objects a and b. Since both a.x and b.x have the same value i.e., 1, so the comparison evaluates to true.</b></li>

### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = 'Lydia';
  let age = 21;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Lydia` and `undefined`
- B: `Lydia` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2` and `0 1 2`
- B: `0 1 2` and `3 3 3`
- C: `3 3 3` and `0 1 2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.

In the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.

### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

Since there is no value `radius` in the scope of the arrow function, `this.radius` returns `undefined` which, when multiplied by `2 * Math.PI`, results in `NaN`.

### 4. What's the output?

```javascript
+true;
!'Lydia';
```

- A: `1` and `false`
- B: `false` and `NaN`
- C: `false` and `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The unary plus tries to convert an operand to a number. `true` is `1`, and `false` is `0`.

The string `'Lydia'` is a truthy value. What we're actually asking, is "Is this truthy value falsy?". This returns `false`.

### 5. Which one is true?

```javascript
const bird = {
  size: 'small',
};

const mouse = {
  name: 'Mickey',
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.

### 6. What's the output?

```javascript
let c = { greeting: 'Hey!' };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ko5k0fs.png" width="200">

When you change one object, you change all of them.

### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
let a = 3;
let b = new Number(3);
let c = 3;

console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(b === c);
```

- A: `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `true` `false` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator (Equality operator), it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator (Strict equality operator), both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`

### 8. What's the output?

```javascript
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = 'green' } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: 'purple' });
console.log(freddie.colorChange('orange'));
```

- A: `orange`
- B: `purple`
- C: `green`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `colorChange` function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children or called upon class instances. Since `freddie` is an instance of class Chameleon, the function cannot be called upon it. A `TypeError` is thrown.

### 9. What's the output?

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {}; // Typo!
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as:

1. `global.greetign = {}` in Node.js
2. `window.greetign = {}`, `frames.greetign = {}` and `self.greetign` in browsers.
3. `self.greetign` in web workers.
4. `globalThis.greetign` in all environments.

In order to avoid this, we can use `"use strict"`. This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything.

### 10. What happens when we do this?

```javascript
function bark() {
  console.log('Woof!');
}

bark.animal = 'dog';
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

### 11. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const member = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
Person.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

console.log(member.getFullName());
```

- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`. 

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```

</p>

### 12. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const lydia = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
const sarah = Person('Sarah', 'Smith');

console.log(lydia);
console.log(sarah);
```

- A: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `undefined`
- B: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `Person {firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Smith"}`
- C: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `{}`
- D: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

For `sarah`, we didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the **global object**!

We said that `this.firstName` equals `"Sarah"` and `this.lastName` equals `"Smith"`. What we actually did, is defining `global.firstName = 'Sarah'` and `global.lastName = 'Smith'`. `sarah` itself is left `undefined`, since we don't return a value from the `Person` function.

### 13. What are the three phases of event propagation?

- A: Target > Capturing > Bubbling
- B: Bubbling > Target > Capturing
- C: Target > Bubbling > Capturing
- D: Capturing > Target > Bubbling

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

During the **capturing** phase, the event goes through the ancestor elements down to the target element. It then reaches the **target** element, and **bubbling** begins.

### 14. All object have prototypes.

- A: true
- B: false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

All objects have prototypes, except for the **base object**. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.

### 15. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, '2');
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `"Hello" + "World"`, so what's happening here is `"1" + "2"` which returns `"12"`.

### 16. What's the output?

```javascript
let number = 0;
console.log(number++);
console.log(++number);
console.log(number);
```

- A: `1` `1` `2`
- B: `1` `2` `2`
- C: `0` `2` `2`
- D: `0` `1` `2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The **postfix** unary operator `++`:

1. Returns the value (this returns `0`)
2. Increments the value (number is now `1`)

The **prefix** unary operator `++`:

1. Increments the value (number is now `2`)
2. Returns the value (this returns `2`)

This returns `0 2 2`.

    console.log('You are still an adult.');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`);
  }
}

checkAge({ age: 18 });
```

- A: `You are an adult!`
- B: `You are still an adult.`
- C: `Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When testing equality, primitives are compared by their _value_, while objects are compared by their _reference_. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.

The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality.

This is why both `{ age: 18 } === { age: 18 }` and `{ age: 18 } == { age: 18 }` return `false`.

- C: `"object"`
- D: `"NaN"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

### 20. What's the output?

```javascript
function getAge() {

getAge();
```

- A: `21`
- B: `undefined`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With `"use strict"`, you can make sure that you don't accidentally declare global variables. We never declared the variable `age`, and since we use `"use strict"`, it will throw a reference error. If we didn't use `"use strict"`, it would have worked, since the property `age` would have gotten added to the global object.

### 21. What's the value of `sum`?

```javascript
const sum = eval('10*10+5');

- A: `105`
- B: `"105"`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `"10*10+5"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`eval` evaluates code that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, it evaluates the expression. The expression is `10 * 10 + 5`. This returns the number `105`.

- C: When the user closes the entire browser, not only the tab.
- D: When the user shuts off their computer.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- A: `8`
- B: `10`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `var` keyword, you can declare multiple variables with the same name. The variable will then hold the latest value.

You cannot do this with `let` or `const` since they're block-scoped and therefore can't be redeclared.

- C: `true` `true` `false` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why `obj.hasOwnProperty('1')` also returns true.

It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no `'1'` in our set: `set.has('1')` returns `false`. It has the numeric type `1`, `set.has(1)` returns `true`.

```

- A: `123`
- B: `456`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.

- C: `Second` `First` `Third`
- D: `Second` `Third` `First`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We have a `setTimeout` function and invoked it first. Yet, it was logged last.

This is because in browsers, we don't just have the runtime engine, we also have something called a `WebAPI`. The `WebAPI` gives us the `setTimeout` function to start with, and for example the DOM.

After the _callback_ is pushed to the WebAPI, the `setTimeout` function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X5wsHOg.png" width="200">

Now, `foo` gets invoked, and `"First"` is being logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pvc0dGq.png" width="200">

`foo` is popped off the stack, and `baz` gets invoked. `"Third"` gets logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WhA2bCP.png" width="200">

The WebAPI can't just add stuff to the stack whenever it's ready. Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the _queue_.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NSnDZmU.png" width="200">

This is where an event loop starts to work. An **event loop** looks at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uyiScAI.png" width="200">

`bar` gets invoked, `"Second"` gets logged, and it's popped off the stack.

There are 8 falsy values:

- `undefined`
- `null`
- `NaN`
- `false`
- `''` (empty string)
- `0`
- `-0`
- `0n` (BigInt(0))

Function constructors, like `new Number` and `new Boolean` are truthy.

### 37. What's the output?

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[10] = 11;
console.log(numbers);
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, null x 7, 11]`

- C: `[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When you set a value to an element in an array that exceeds the length of the array, JavaScript creates something called "empty slots". These actually have the value of `undefined`, but you will see something like:

`[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`

depending on where you run it (it's different for every browser, node, etc.)

    (x = 1), (y = 2);
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
})();
```

- A: `1` `undefined` `2`
- B: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- C: `1` `1` `2`
- D: `1` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `catch` block receives the argument `x`. This is not the same `x` as the variable when we pass arguments. This variable `x` is block-scoped.

Later, we set this block-scoped variable equal to `1`, and set the value of the variable `y`. Now, we log the block-scoped variable `x`, which is equal to `1`.

Outside of the `catch` block, `x` is still `undefined`, and `y` is `2`. When we want to `console.log(x)` outside of the `catch` block, it returns `undefined`, and `y` returns `2`.

### 39. Everything in JavaScript is either a...

- A: primitive or object
- B: function or object
- C: trick question! only objects
- D: number or object

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

JavaScript only has primitive types and objects.

Primitive types are `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

What differentiates a primitive from an object is that primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note that `'foo'.toUpperCase()` evaluates to `'FOO'` and does not result in a `TypeError`. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates. All primitives except for `null` and `undefined` exhibit this behavior.

### 40. What's the output?

```javascript
[[0, 1], [2, 3]].reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);
```

- A: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]`
- B: `[6, 1, 2]`
- C: `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
- D: `[1, 2, 6]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`

- C: `10, 20`
- D: `0, 10 and 10, 20`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Regular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.

First, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now "paused", and `10` gets logged.

Then, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`.

### 45. What does this return?

```javascript

Promise.race([firstPromise, secondPromise]).then(res => console.log(res));
```

- A: `"one"`
- B: `"two"`
- C: `"two" "one"`
- D: `"one" "two"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promise.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

### 46. What's the output?

```

- A: `null`
- B: `[null]`
- C: `[{}]`
- D: `[{ name: "Lydia" }]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

First, we declare a variable `person` with the value of an object that has a `name` property.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TML1MbS.png" width="200">

Then, we declare a variable called `members`. We set the first element of that array equal to the value of the `person` variable. Objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other. When you assign a reference from one variable to another, you make a _copy_ of that reference. (note that they don't have the _same_ reference!)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FSG5K3F.png" width="300">

Then, we set the variable `person` equal to `null`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sYjcsMT.png" width="300">

We are only modifying the value of the `person` variable, and not the first element in the array, since that element has a different (copied) reference to the object. The first element in `members` still holds its reference to the original object. When we log the `members` array, the first element still holds the value of the object, which gets logged.

- C: `"Lydia", 21`
- D: `["name", "Lydia"], ["age", 21]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys, in this case `name` and `age`. Under the hood, object keys are strings (if they're not a Symbol). On every loop, we set the value of `item` equal to the current key it’s iterating over. First, `item` is equal to `name`, and gets logged. Then, `item` is equal to `age`, which gets logged.

### 48. What's the output?

```javascript

```

- A: `"345"`
- B: `"75"`
- C: `12`
- D: `"12"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Operator associativity is the order in which the compiler evaluates the expressions, either left-to-right or right-to-left. This only happens if all operators have the _same_ precedence. We only have one type of operator: `+`. For addition, the associativity is left-to-right.

`3 + 4` gets evaluated first. This results in the number `7`.

`7 + '5'` results in `"75"` because of coercion. JavaScript converts the number `7` into a string, see question 15. We can concatenate two strings using the `+`operator. `"7" + "5"` results in `"75"`.

### 49. What's the value of `num`?

```javascript
const num = parseInt('7*6', 10);
```

- A: `42`
- B: `"42"`
- C: `7`
- D: `NaN`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Only the first number in the string is returned. Based on the _radix_ (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the `parseInt` checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters.

`*` is not a valid number. It only parses `"7"` into the decimal `7`. `num` now holds the value of `7`.

### 50. What's the output?

```javascript
[1, 2, 3].map(num => {
  if (typeof num === 'number') return;
  return num * 2;
});
```

- A: `[]`
- B: `[null, null, null]`
- C: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`
- D: `[ 3 x empty ]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When mapping over the array, the value of `num` is equal to the element it’s currently looping over. In this case, the elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement `typeof num === "number"` returns `true`. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function.

However, we don’t return a value. When we don’t return a value from the function, the function returns `undefined`. For every element in the array, the function block gets called, so for each element we return `undefined`.

### 51. What's the output?

getInfo(person, birthYear);

console.log(person, birthYear);
```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1997"`
- B: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1998"`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1998"`
- D: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1997"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Arguments are passed by _value_, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by _reference_. `birthYear` is passed by value, since it's a string, not an object. When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).

The variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `"1997"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `"1997"`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `"1998"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `"1997"`.

The value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`'s `name` property is now equal to the value `"Lydia"`

- C: `SyntaxError: can only throw Error objects`
- D: `Oh no an error: Hello world!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With the `throw` statement, we can create custom errors. With this statement, you can throw exceptions. An exception can be a <b>string</b>, a <b>number</b>, a <b>boolean</b> or an <b>object</b>. In this case, our exception is the string `'Hello world!'`.

With the `catch` statement, we can specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. An exception is thrown: the string `'Hello world!'`. `e` is now equal to that string, which we log. This results in `'Oh an error: Hello world!'`.

```

- A: `"Lamborghini"`
- B: `"Maserati"`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When a constructor function is called with the `new` keyword, it creates an object and sets the `this` keyword to refer to that object. By default, if the constructor function doesn't explicitly return anything, it will return the newly created object.

In this case, the constructor function `Car` explicitly returns a new object with `make` set to `"Maserati"`, which overrides the default behavior. Therefore, when `new Car()` is called, the _returned_ object is assigned to `myCar`, resulting in the output being `"Maserati"` when `myCar.make` is accessed.

```javascript

- A: `"undefined", "number"`
- B: `"number", "number"`
- C: `"object", "number"`
- D: `"number", "undefined"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`let x = (y = 10);` is actually shorthand for:

```javascript
y = 10;
let x = y;
```

When we set `y` equal to `10`, we actually add a property `y` to the global object (`window` in the browser, `global` in Node). In a browser, `window.y` is now equal to `10`.

Then, we declare a variable `x` with the value of `y`, which is `10`. Variables declared with the `let` keyword are _block scoped_, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `"undefined"`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `"undefined"`.

However, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`. This value is accessible anywhere in our code. `y` is defined, and holds a value of type `"number"`. `console.log(typeof y)` returns `"number"`.

- C: `"Woof I am Mara"`, `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`, `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We can delete properties from objects using the `delete` keyword, also on the prototype. By deleting a property on the prototype, it is not available anymore in the prototype chain. In this case, the `bark` function is not available anymore on the prototype after `delete Dog.prototype.bark`, yet we still try to access it.

When we try to invoke something that is not a function, a `TypeError` is thrown. In this case `TypeError: pet.bark is not a function`, since `pet.bark` is `undefined`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `Set` object is a collection of _unique_ values: a value can only occur once in a set.

We passed the iterable `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with a duplicate value `1`. Since we cannot have two of the same values in a set, one of them is removed. This results in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

- B: `"Lydia"`, `21`
- C: `true`, `true`
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const`, or `let` keywords cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.

#### Answer: C

We can unpack values from arrays or properties from objects through destructuring. For example:

```javascript
[a, b] = [1, 2];
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ADFpVop.png" width="200">

The value of `a` is now `1`, and the value of `b` is now `2`. What we actually did in the question, is:

```javascript
[y] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NzGkMNk.png" width="200">

This means that the value of `y` is equal to the first value in the array, which is the number `1`. When we log `y`, `1` is returned.

- D: `{ admin: true }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

It's possible to combine objects using the spread operator `...`. It lets you create copies of the key/value pairs of one object, and add them to another object. In this case, we create copies of the `user` object, and add them to the `admin` object. The `admin` object now contains the copied key/value pairs, which results in `{ admin: true, name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`.

- C: `{ name: "Lydia"}`, `["name", "age"]`
- D: `{ name: "Lydia"}`, `["age"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default _not enumerable_. The `Object.keys` method returns all _enumerable_ property names from an object, in this case only `"name"`.

Properties added using the `defineProperty` method are immutable by default. You can override this behavior using the `writable`, `configurable` and `enumerable` properties. This way, the `defineProperty` method gives you a lot more control over the properties you're adding to an object.

- C: `"["level", "health"]"`
- D: `"{"username": "lydiahallie", "level":19, "health":90}"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The second argument of `JSON.stringify` is the _replacer_. The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an _array_, only the property names included in the array will be added to the JSON string. In this case, only the properties with the names `"level"` and `"health"` are included, `"username"` is excluded. `data` is now equal to `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`.

If the replacer is a _function_, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying. The value returned from this function will be the value of the property when it's added to the JSON string. If the value is `undefined`, this property is excluded from the JSON string.

The unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `num1` is `10`, since the `increaseNumber` function first returns the value of `num`, which is `10`, and only increments the value of `num` afterward.

`num2` is `10`, since we passed `num1` to the `increasePassedNumber`. `number` is equal to `10`(the value of `num1`). Again, the unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `number` is `10`, so `num2` is equal to `10`.

const multiply = (x = { ...value }) => {
  console.log((x.number *= 2));
};

multiply();
multiply();
multiply(value);
multiply(value);

- B: `20`, `40`, `20`, `40`
- C: `20`, `20`, `20`, `40`
- D: `NaN`, `NaN`, `20`, `40`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

In ES6, we can initialize parameters with a default value. The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is `"undefined"`. In this case, we spread the properties of the `value` object into a new object, so `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`.

The default argument is evaluated at _call time_! Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`.

The third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`.

The fourth time, we pass the `value` object again. `x.number` was previously modified to `20`, so `x.number *= 2` logs `40`.

### 65. What's the output?

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce((x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```

- A: `1` `2` and `3` `3` and `6` `4`
- B: `1` `2` and `2` `3` and `3` `4`
- C: `1` `undefined` and `2` `undefined` and `3` `undefined` and `4` `undefined`
- D: `1` `2` and `undefined` `3` and `undefined` `4`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the _accumulator_, `x` in this case. The second argument is the _current value_, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.

The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.

On the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator, and the current values: `1` and `2` get logged.

If you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged.

On the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.

### 66. With which constructor can we successfully extend the `Dog` class?

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
};

class Labrador extends Dog {
  // 1
  constructor(name, size) {
    this.size = size;
  }
  // 2
  constructor(name, size) {
    super(name);
    this.size = size;
  }
  // 3
  constructor(size) {
    super(name);
    this.size = size;
  }
  // 4
  constructor(name, size) {
    this.name = name;
    this.size = size;
  }

};
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In a derived class, you cannot access the `this` keyword before calling `super`. If you try to do that, it will throw a ReferenceError: 1 and 4 would throw a reference error.

With the `super` keyword, we call that parent class's constructor with the given arguments. The parent's constructor receives the `name` argument, so we need to pass `name` to `super`.

The `Labrador` class receives two arguments, `name` since it extends `Dog`, and `size` as an extra property on the `Labrador` class. They both need to be passed to the constructor function on `Labrador`, which is done correctly using constructor 2.

### 67. What's the output?

```javascript

import { sum } from './sum.js';
console.log(sum(1, 2));

// sum.js
console.log('running sum.js');
export const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

- A: `running index.js`, `running sum.js`, `3`
- B: `running sum.js`, `running index.js`, `3`
- C: `running sum.js`, `3`, `running index.js`
- D: `running index.js`, `undefined`, `running sum.js`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `import` keyword, all imported modules are _pre-parsed_. This means that the imported modules get run _first_, and the code in the file that imports the module gets executed _after_.

This is a difference between `require()` in CommonJS and `import`! With `require()`, you can load dependencies on demand while the code is being run. If we had used `require` instead of `import`, `running index.js`, `running sum.js`, `3` would have been logged to the console.

### 68. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(Number(2) === Number(2));
console.log(Boolean(false) === Boolean(false));
console.log(Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo'));
```

- A: `true`, `true`, `false`
- B: `false`, `true`, `false`
- C: `true`, `false`, `true`
- D: `true`, `true`, `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Every Symbol is entirely unique. The purpose of the argument passed to the Symbol is to give the Symbol a description. The value of the Symbol is not dependent on the passed argument. As we test equality, we are creating two entirely new symbols: the first `Symbol('foo')`, and the second `Symbol('foo')`. These two values are unique and not equal to each other, `Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo')` returns `false`.

### 69. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia Hallie';
console.log(name.padStart(13));
console.log(name.padStart(2));
```

- A: `"Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lydia Hallie"`
- B: `" Lydia Hallie"`, `" Lydia Hallie"` (`"[13x whitespace]Lydia Hallie"`, `"[2x whitespace]Lydia Hallie"`)
- C: `" Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lydia Hallie"` (`"[1x whitespace]Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lydia Hallie"`)
- D: `"Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lyd"`,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `padStart` method, we can add padding to the beginning of a string. The value passed to this method is the _total_ length of the string together with the padding. The string `"Lydia Hallie"` has a length of `12`. `name.padStart(13)` inserts 1 space at the start of the string, because 12 + 1 is 13.

If the argument passed to the `padStart` method is smaller than the length of the array, no padding will be added.

### 71. How can we log the values that are commented out after the console.log statement?

```javascript
function* startGame() {
  const answer = yield 'Do you love JavaScript?';
  if (answer !== 'Yes') {
    return "Oh wow... Guess we're done here";
  }
  return 'JavaScript loves you back ❤️';
}

const game = startGame();
console.log(/* 1 */); // Do you love JavaScript?
console.log(/* 2 */); // JavaScript loves you back ❤️
```

- A: `game.next("Yes").value` and `game.next().value`
- B: `game.next.value("Yes")` and `game.next.value()`
- C: `game.next().value` and `game.next("Yes").value`
- D: `game.next.value()` and `game.next.value("Yes")`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

A generator function "pauses" its execution when it sees the `yield` keyword. First, we have to let the function yield the string "Do you love JavaScript?", which can be done by calling `game.next().value`.

Every line is executed, until it finds the first `yield` keyword. There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_

When we call `game.next("Yes").value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `"Yes"` in this case. The value of the variable `answer` is now equal to `"Yes"`. The condition of the if-statement returns `false`, and `JavaScript loves you back ❤️` gets logged.

### 72. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(String.raw`Hello\nworld`);
```

- A: `Hello world!`
- B: `Hello` <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`
- C: `Hello\nworld`
- D: `Hello\n` <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`String.raw` returns a string where the escapes (`\n`, `\v`, `\t` etc.) are ignored! Backslashes can be an issue since you could end up with something like:

`` const path = `C:\Documents\Projects\table.html` ``

Which would result in:

`"C:DocumentsProjects able.html"`

With `String.raw`, it would simply ignore the escape and print:

`C:\Documents\Projects\table.html`

In this case, the string is `Hello\nworld`, which gets logged.

### 73. What's the output?

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return await Promise.resolve('I made it!');
}

const data = getData();
console.log(data);
```

- A: `"I made it!"`
- B: `Promise {<resolved>: "I made it!"}`
- C: `Promise {<pending>}`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

An async function always returns a promise. The `await` still has to wait for the promise to resolve: a pending promise gets returned when we call `getData()` in order to set `data` equal to it.

If we wanted to get access to the resolved value `"I made it"`, we could have used the `.then()` method on `data`:

`data.then(res => console.log(res))`

This would've logged `"I made it!"`

### 74. What's the output?

```javascript
function addToList(item, list) {
  return list.push(item);
}

const result = addToList('apple', ['banana']);
console.log(result);
```

- A: `['apple', 'banana']`
- B: `2`
- C: `true`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `.push()` method returns the _length_ of the new array! Previously, the array contained one element (the string `"banana"`) and had a length of `1`. After adding the string `"apple"` to the array, the array contains two elements, and has a length of `2`. This gets returned from the `addToList` function.

The `push` method modifies the original array. If you wanted to return the _array_ from the function rather than the _length of the array_, you should have returned `list` after pushing `item` to it.

### 75. What's the output?

```javascript
const box = { x: 10, y: 20 };

Object.freeze(box);

const shape = box;
shape.x = 100;

console.log(shape);
```

- A: `{ x: 100, y: 20 }`
- B: `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`
- C: `{ x: 100 }`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` would return true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.

### 76. What's the output?

```javascript
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };

console.log(firstName);
```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"myName"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

By using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax we can unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables:

```javascript
const { firstName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };
// ES5 version:
// var firstName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(firstName); // "Lydia"
```

Also, a property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property:

```javascript
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };
// ES5 version:
// var myName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(myName); // "Lydia"
console.log(firstName); // Uncaught ReferenceError: firstName is not defined
```

Therefore, `firstName` does not exist as a variable, thus attempting to access its value will raise a `ReferenceError`.

**Note:** Be aware of the `global scope` properties:

```javascript
const { name: myName } = { name: 'Lydia' };

console.log(myName); // "lydia"
console.log(name); // "" ----- Browser e.g. Chrome
console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined  ----- NodeJS

```

Whenever Javascript is unable to find a variable within the _current scope_, it climbs up the [Scope chain](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch3.md) and searches for it and if it reaches the top-level scope, aka **Global scope**, and still doesn't find it, it will throw a `ReferenceError`.

- In **Browsers** such as _Chrome_, `name` is a _deprecated global scope property_. In this example, the code is running inside _global scope_ and there is no user-defined local variable for `name`, therefore it searches the predefined _variables/properties_ in the global scope which is in the case of browsers, it searches through `window` object and it will extract the [window.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name) value which is equal to an **empty string**.

- In **NodeJS**, there is no such property on the `global` object, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a [ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined).

### 77. Is this a pure function?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- A: Yes
- B: No

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

A pure function is a function that _always_ returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The `sum` function always returns the same result. If we pass `1` and `2`, it will _always_ return `3` without side effects. If we pass `5` and `10`, it will _always_ return `15`, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.

### 78. What is the output?

```javascript
const add = () => {

    } else {
      const result = num + 10;
      cache[num] = result;
      return `Calculated! ${result}`;
    }
  };
};

const addFunction = add();
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(5 * 2));
```

- A: `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- B: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- C: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `From cache! 20`
- D: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.

If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the cache value will be returned, which saves execution time. Otherwise, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterward.

We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.

The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With a _for-in_ loop, we can iterate over **enumerable** properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes. You could see an array as:

`{0: "☕", 1: "💻", 2: "🍷", 3: "🍫"}`

Where the keys are the enumerable properties. `0` `1` `2` `3` get logged.

With a _for-of_ loop, we can iterate over **iterables**. An array is an iterable. When we iterate over the array, the variable "item" is equal to the element it's currently iterating over, `"☕"` `"💻"` `"🍷"` `"🍫"` get logged.

#### Answer: C

Array elements can hold any value. Numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, null, boolean values, undefined, and other expressions such as dates, functions, and calculations.

The element will be equal to the returned value. `1 + 2` returns `3`, `1 * 2` returns `2`, and `1 / 2` returns `0.5`.

- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

By default, arguments have the value of `undefined`, unless a value has been passed to the function. In this case, we didn't pass a value for the `name` argument. `name` is equal to `undefined` which gets logged.

In ES6, we can overwrite this default `undefined` value with default parameters. For example:

`function sayHi(name = "Lydia") { ... }`

In this case, if we didn't pass a value or if we passed `undefined`, `name` would always be equal to the string `Lydia`

  console.log(data.getStatus.call(this));
}, 0);

- A: `"🥑"` and `"😍"`
- B: `"🥑"` and `"😎"`
- C: `"😍"` and `"😎"`
- D: `"😎"` and `"😎"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to _the object that the method belongs to_. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `"🥑"`.

With the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the _the object that the function belongs to_. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the _global object_, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the _global object_. On the global object, there is a variable called _status_ with the value of `"😎"`. When logging `this.status`, `"😎"` gets logged.

- A: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- B: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: "Amsterdam" }`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: undefined }`
- D: `"Amsterdam"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `city` equal to the value of the property called `city` on the `person` object. There is no property on this object called `city`, so the variable `city` has the value of `undefined`.

Note that we are _not_ referencing the `person` object itself! We simply set the variable `city` equal to the current value of the `city` property on the `person` object.

Then, we set `city` equal to the string `"Amsterdam"`. This doesn't change the person object: there is no reference to that object.

When logging the `person` object, the unmodified object gets returned.

### 86. Which option is a way to set `hasName` equal to `true`, provided you cannot pass `true` as an argument?

```javascript
function getName(name) {
  const hasName = //
}
```

- A: `!!name`
- B: `name`
- C: `new Boolean(name)`
- D: `name.length`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `!!name`, we determine whether the value of `name` is truthy or falsy. If the name is truthy, which we want to test for, `!name` returns `false`. `!false` (which is what `!!name` practically is) returns `true`.

By setting `hasName` equal to `name`, you set `hasName` equal to whatever value you passed to the `getName` function, not the boolean value `true`.

`new Boolean(true)` returns an object wrapper, not the boolean value itself.

`name.length` returns the length of the passed argument, not whether it's `true`.

### 87. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log('I want pizza'[0]);
```

- A: `"""`
- B: `"I"`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In order to get a character at a specific index of a string, you can use bracket notation. The first character in the string has index 0, and so on. In this case, we want to get the element with index 0, the character `"I'`, which gets logged.

Note that this method is not supported in IE7 and below. In that case, use `.charAt()`.

### 88. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2 = num1) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}

sum(10);
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `20`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, as long as they've been defined _before_ the default parameter. We pass the value `10` to the `sum` function. If the `sum` function only receives 1 argument, it means that the value for `num2` is not passed, and the value of `num1` is equal to the passed value `10` in this case. The default value of `num2` is the value of `num1`, which is `10`. `num1 + num2` returns `20`.

If you're trying to set a default parameter's value equal to a parameter that is defined _after_ (to the right), the parameter's value hasn't been initialized yet, which will throw an error.

### 89. What's the output?

```javascript
// module.js
export default () => 'Hello world';
export const name = 'Lydia';

// index.js
import * as data from './module';

console.log(data);
```

- A: `{ default: function default(), name: "Lydia" }`
- B: `{ default: function default() }`
- C: `{ default: "Hello world", name: "Lydia" }`
- D: Global object of `module.js`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With the `import * as name` syntax, we import _all exports_ from the `module.js` file into the `index.js` file as a new object called `data` is created. In the `module.js` file, there are two exports: the default export, and a named export. The default export is a function that returns the string `"Hello World"`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `"Lydia"`.

The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values.

### 90. What's the output?

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const member = new Person('John');
console.log(typeof member);
```

- A: `"class"`
- B: `"function"`
- C: `"object"`
- D: `"string"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Classes are syntactical sugar for function constructors. The equivalent of the `Person` class as a function constructor would be:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

Calling a function constructor with `new` results in the creation of an instance of `Person`, `typeof` keyword returns `"object"` for an instance. `typeof member` returns `"object"`.

### 91. What's the output?

```javascript
let newList = [1, 2, 3].push(4);

console.log(newList.push(5));
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- B: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `.push` method returns the _new length_ of the array, not the array itself! By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`.

Then, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.

### 92. What's the output?

```javascript
function giveLydiaPizza() {
  return 'Here is pizza!';

  "Here's chocolate... now go hit the gym already.";

console.log(giveLydiaPizza.prototype);
console.log(giveLydiaChocolate.prototype);

- A: `{ constructor: ...}` `{ constructor: ...}`
- B: `{}` `{ constructor: ...}`
- C: `{ constructor: ...}` `{}`
- D: `{ constructor: ...}` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Regular functions, such as the `giveLydiaPizza` function, have a `prototype` property, which is an object (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however, such as the `giveLydiaChocolate` function, do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property using `giveLydiaChocolate.prototype`.

### 93. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

for (const [x, y] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(x, y);
}
```

- A: `name` `Lydia` and `age` `21`
- B: `["name", "Lydia"]` and `["age", 21]`
- C: `["name", "age"]` and `undefined`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged.
The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.

```

- A: `["banana", "apple", "pear", "orange"]`
- B: `[["banana", "apple"], "pear", "orange"]`
- C: `["banana", "apple", ["pear"], "orange"]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`...args` is a rest parameter. The rest parameter's value is an array containing all remaining arguments, **and can only be the last parameter**! In this example, the rest parameter was the second parameter. This is not possible, and will throw a syntax error.

```javascript
function getItems(fruitList, favoriteFruit, ...args) {
  return [...fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit];
}

getItems(['banana', 'apple'], 'pear', 'orange');
```

The above example works. This returns the array `[ 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'pear' ]`

- A: `a is bigger`, `6` and `b is bigger`, `3`
- B: `a is bigger`, `undefined` and `b is bigger`, `undefined`
- C: `undefined` and `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!

```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"Sarah"`
- C: `Error: cannot redeclare Person`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We can set classes equal to other classes/function constructors. In this case, we set `Person` equal to `AnotherPerson`. The name on this constructor is `Sarah`, so the name property on the new `Person` instance `member` is `"Sarah"`.

### 97. What's the output?

```javascript
const info = {

- A: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `["{Symbol('a')"]`
- B: `{}` and `[]`
- C: `{ a: "b" }` and `["a"]`
- D: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `[]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

A Symbol is not _enumerable_. The Object.keys method returns all _enumerable_ key properties on an object. The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will be visible, even non-enumerable ones.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also "hide" properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).

### 98. What's the output?

```javascript
const getList = ([x, ...y]) => [x, y]
const getUser = user => { name: user.name, age: user.age }

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const user = { name: "Lydia", age: 21 }

console.log(getList(list))
console.log(getUser(user))
```

- A: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `SyntaxError`
- B: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- D: `Error` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `getList` function receives an array as its argument. Between the parentheses of the `getList` function, we destructure this array right away. You could see this as:

`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

With the rest parameter `...y`, we put all "remaining" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.

The `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don't _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to instantly return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise everything between the two braces will be interpreted as a block statement. In this case the code between the braces is not a valid JavaScript code, so a `SyntaxError` gets thrown. 

The following function would have returned an object:

`const getUser = user => ({ name: user.name, age: user.age })`

### 99. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia';

console.log(name());
```

- A: `SyntaxError`
- B: `ReferenceError`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The variable `name` holds the value of a string, which is not a function, and thus cannot be invoked.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected `name` to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word `return` as `retrun`.
ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.

- D: `Impossible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`[]` is a truthy value. With the `&&` operator, the right-hand value will be returned if the left-hand value is a truthy value. In this case, the left-hand value `[]` is a truthy value, so `"Im'` gets returned.

`""` is a falsy value. If the left-hand value is falsy, nothing gets returned. `n't` doesn't get returned.

- C: `{}` `""` `[]`
- D: `null` `null` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `||` operator, we can return the first truthy operand. If all values are falsy, the last operand gets returned.

`(false || {} || null)`: the empty object `{}` is a truthy value. This is the first (and only) truthy value, which gets returned. `one` is equal to `{}`.

`(null || false || "")`: all operands are falsy values. This means that the last operand, `""` gets returned. `two` is equal to `""`.

`([] || 0 || "")`: the empty array`[]` is a truthy value. This is the first truthy value, which gets returned. `three` is equal to `[]`.

- D: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `I have resolved!`, `second`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keywords in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.

- B: `3`, `7`, `NaN`
- C: `3`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`
- D: `"12"`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `+` operator is not only used for adding numerical values, but we can also use it to concatenate strings. Whenever the JavaScript engine sees that one or more values are not a number, it coerces the number into a string.

The first one is `1`, which is a numerical value. `1 + 2` returns the number 3.

However, the second one is a string `"Lydia"`. `"Lydia"` is a string and `2` is a number: `2` gets coerced into a string. `"Lydia"` and `"2"` get concatenated, which results in the string `"Lydia2"`.

`{ name: "Lydia" }` is an object. Neither a number nor an object is a string, so it stringifies both. Whenever we stringify a regular object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. `"[object Object]"` concatenated with `"2"` becomes `"[object Object]2"`.

- B: `Promise {<pending>: 5}`
- C: `Promise {<fulfilled>: 5}`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

We can pass any type of value we want to `Promise.resolve`, either a promise or a non-promise. The method itself returns a promise with the resolved value (`<fulfilled>`). If you pass a regular function, it'll be a resolved promise with a regular value. If you pass a promise, it'll be a resolved promise with the resolved value of that passed promise.

In this case, we just passed the numerical value `5`. It returns a resolved promise with the value `5`.

- A: `Not the same!`
- B: `They are the same!`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.

### 106. What's its value?

console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]);
```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation. In this example, we use dot notation (`colorConfig.colors`) instead of bracket notation (`colorConfig["colors"]`).

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. If we would've used `colorConfig[colors[1]]`, it would have returned the value of the `red` property on the `colorConfig` object.

- B: `map` `reduce` `slice` `splice`
- C: `map` `slice` `splice`
- D: `splice`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With `splice` method, we modify the original array by deleting, replacing or adding elements. In this case, we removed 2 items from index 1 (we removed `'🥑'` and `'😍'`) and added the ✨ emoji instead.

`map`, `filter` and `slice` return a new array, `find` returns an element, and `reduce` returns a reduced value.

- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'🍕'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types don't interact by reference.

In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by _value_. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'🍕'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more)

Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a _copy_ of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`.

JSON.parse(jsonNumber); // 4

// Stringifying an array value into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // '[1, 2, 3]'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Stringifying an object  into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify({ name: 'Lydia' }); // '{"name":"Lydia"}'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // { name: 'Lydia' }

function getName() {

}

getName();
```

- A: Lydia
- B: Sarah
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.

```javascript
let name = 'Lydia';

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
}

getName(); // Lydia
```

```javascript
function* generatorOne() {
  yield ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}

function* generatorTwo() {
  yield* ['a', 'b', 'c'];
}

const one = generatorOne();
const two = generatorTwo();

console.log(one.next().value);
console.log(two.next().value);
```

- A: `a` and `a`
- B: `a` and `undefined`
- C: `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `a`
- D: `a` and `['a', 'b', 'c']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `yield` keyword, we `yield` values in a generator function. With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array).

In `generatorOne`, we yield the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']` using the `yield` keyword. The value of `value` property on the object returned by the `next` method on `one` (`one.next().value`) is equal to the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

```javascript
console.log(one.next().value); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(one.next().value); // undefined
```

In `generatorTwo`, we use the `yield*` keyword. This means that the first yielded value of `two`, is equal to the first yielded value in the iterator. The iterator is the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`. The first yielded value is `a`, so the first time we call `two.next().value`, `a` is returned.

```javascript
console.log(two.next().value); // 'a'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'b'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'c'
console.log(two.next().value); // undefined
```

### 113. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(`${(x => x)('I love')} to program`);
```

- A: `I love to program`
- B: `undefined to program`
- C: `${(x => x)('I love') to program`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Expressions within template literals are evaluated first. This means that the string will contain the returned value of the expression, the immediately invoked function `(x => x)('I love')` in this case. We pass the value `'I love'` as an argument to the `x => x` arrow function. `x` is equal to `'I love'`, which gets returned. This results in `I love to program`.

### 114. What will happen?

```javascript
let config = {
  alert: setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Alert!');
  }, 1000),
};

config = null;
```

- A: The `setInterval` callback won't be invoked
- B: The `setInterval` callback gets invoked once
- C: The `setInterval` callback will still be called every second
- D: We never invoked `config.alert()`, config is `null`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Normally when we set objects equal to `null`, those objects get _garbage collected_ as there is no reference anymore to that object. However, since the callback function within `setInterval` is an arrow function (thus bound to the `config` object), the callback function still holds a reference to the `config` object. 
As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. 
Since this is an interval, setting `config` to `null` or `delete`-ing `config.alert` won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called. 
It should be cleared with `clearInterval(config.alert)` to remove it from memory.
Since it was not cleared, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).

### 115. Which method(s) will return the value `'Hello world!'`?

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
const myFunc = () => 'greeting';

myMap.set(myFunc, 'Hello world!');

//1
myMap.get('greeting');
//2
myMap.get(myFunc);
//3
myMap.get(() => 'greeting');
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 2 and 3
- D: All of them

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When adding a key/value pair using the `set` method, the key will be the value of the first argument passed to the `set` function, and the value will be the second argument passed to the `set` function. The key is the _function_ `() => 'greeting'` in this case, and the value `'Hello world'`. `myMap` is now `{ () => 'greeting' => 'Hello world!' }`.

1 is wrong, since the key is not `'greeting'` but `() => 'greeting'`.
3 is wrong, since we're creating a new function by passing it as a parameter to the `get` method. Object interacts by _reference_. Functions are objects, which is why two functions are never strictly equal, even if they are identical: they have a reference to a different spot in memory.

### 116. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

const changeAge = (x = { ...person }) => (x.age += 1);
const changeAgeAndName = (x = { ...person }) => {
  x.age += 1;
  x.name = 'Sarah';
};

changeAge(person);
changeAgeAndName();

console.log(person);
```

- A: `{name: "Sarah", age: 22}`
- B: `{name: "Sarah", age: 23}`
- C: `{name: "Lydia", age: 22}`
- D: `{name: "Lydia", age: 23}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Both the `changeAge` and `changeAgeAndName` functions have a default parameter, namely a _newly_ created object `{ ...person }`. This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`. Since it's a new object, it doesn't affect the values of the properties on the `person` object. `person` is still equal to `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

### 117. Which of the following options will return `6`?

```javascript
function sumValues(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
```

- A: `sumValues([...1, 2, 3])`
- B: `sumValues([...[1, 2, 3]])`
- C: `sumValues(...[1, 2, 3])`
- D: `sumValues([1, 2, 3])`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the spread operator `...`, we can _spread_ iterables to individual elements. The `sumValues` function receives three arguments: `x`, `y` and `z`. `...[1, 2, 3]` will result in `1, 2, 3`, which we pass to the `sumValues` function.

### 118. What's the output?

```javascript
let num = 1;
const list = ['🥳', '🤠', '🥰', '🤪'];

console.log(list[(num += 1)]);
```

- A: `🤠`
- B: `🥰`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `+=` operator, we're incrementing the value of `num` by `1`. `num` had the initial value `1`, so `1 + 1` is `2`. The item on the second index in the `list` array is 🥰, `console.log(list[2])` prints 🥰.

</p>

### 119. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'Lydia',
  lastName: 'Hallie',
  pet: {
    name: 'Mara',
    breed: 'Dutch Tulip Hound',
  },
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};

console.log(person.pet?.name);
console.log(person.pet?.family?.name);
console.log(person.getFullName?.());
console.log(member.getLastName?.());
```

- A: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- B: `Mara` `undefined` `Lydia Hallie` `ReferenceError`
- C: `Mara` `null` `Lydia Hallie` `null`
- D: `null` `ReferenceError` `null` `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the optional chaining operator `?.`, we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an `undefined` or `null` value (_nullish_), the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

`person.pet?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. It has a property called `name`, and returns `Mara`.
`person.pet?.family?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. `pet` does _not_ have a property called `family`, `person.pet.family` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.
`person.getFullName?.()`: `person` has a property named `getFullName`: `person.getFullName()` is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns `Lydia Hallie`.
`member.getLastName?.()`: variable `member` is non-existent therefore a `ReferenceError` gets thrown!

### 120. What's the output?

```javascript
const groceries = ['banana', 'apple', 'peanuts'];

if (groceries.indexOf('banana')) {
  console.log('We have to buy bananas!');
} else {
  console.log(`We don't have to buy bananas!`);
}
```

- A: We have to buy bananas!
- B: We don't have to buy bananas
- C: `undefined`
- D: `1`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We passed the condition `groceries.indexOf("banana")` to the if-statement. `groceries.indexOf("banana")` returns `0`, which is a falsy value. Since the condition in the if-statement is falsy, the code in the `else` block runs, and `We don't have to buy bananas!` gets logged.

### 121. What's the output?

```javascript
const config = {
  languages: [],
  set language(lang) {
    return this.languages.push(lang);
  },
};

console.log(config.language);
```

- A: `function language(lang) { this.languages.push(lang }`
- B: `0`
- C: `[]`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `language` method is a `setter`. Setters don't hold an actual value, their purpose is to _modify_ properties. When calling a `setter` method, `undefined` gets returned.

### 122. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia Hallie';

console.log(!typeof name === 'object');
console.log(!typeof name === 'string');
```

- A: `false` `true`
- B: `true` `false`
- C: `false` `false`
- D: `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`typeof name` returns `"string"`. The string `"string"` is a truthy value, so `!typeof name` returns the boolean value `false`. `false === "object"` and `false === "string"` both return`false`.

(If we wanted to check whether the type was (un)equal to a certain type, we should've written `!==` instead of `!typeof`)

</p>

### 123. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = x => y => z => {
  console.log(x, y, z);
  return x + y + z;
};

add(4)(5)(6);
```

- A: `4` `5` `6`
- B: `6` `5` `4`
- C: `4` `function` `function`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `6`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `add` function returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function (still with me?). The first function receives an argument `x` with the value of `4`. We invoke the second function, which receives an argument `y` with the value `5`. Then we invoke the third function, which receives an argument `z` with the value `6`. When we're trying to access the value `x`, `y` and `z` within the last arrow function, the JS engine goes up the scope chain in order to find the values for `x` and `y` accordingly. This returns `4` `5` `6`.

### 124. What's the output?

```javascript
async function* range(start, end) {
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    yield Promise.resolve(i);
  }
}

(async () => {
  const gen = range(1, 3);
  for await (const item of gen) {
    console.log(item);
  }
})();
```

- A: `Promise {1}` `Promise {2}` `Promise {3}`
- B: `Promise {<pending>}` `Promise {<pending>}` `Promise {<pending>}`
- C: `1` `2` `3`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The generator function `range` returns an async object with promises for each item in the range we pass: `Promise{1}`, `Promise{2}`, `Promise{3}`. We set the variable `gen` equal to the async object, after which we loop over it using a `for await ... of` loop. We set the variable `item` equal to the returned Promise values: first `Promise{1}`, then `Promise{2}`, then `Promise{3}`. Since we're _awaiting_ the value of `item`, the resolved promise, the resolved _values_ of the promises get returned: `1`, `2`, then `3`.

### 125. What's the output?

```javascript
const myFunc = ({ x, y, z }) => {
  console.log(x, y, z);
};

myFunc(1, 2, 3);
```

- A: `1` `2` `3`
- B: `{1: 1}` `{2: 2}` `{3: 3}`
- C: `{ 1: undefined }` `undefined` `undefined`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`myFunc` expects an object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` as its argument. Since we're only passing three separate numeric values (1, 2, 3) instead of one object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` ({x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}), `x`, `y` and `z` have their default value of `undefined`.

### 126. What's the output?

```javascript
function getFine(speed, amount) {
  const formattedSpeed = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {

  const formattedAmount = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD'
  }).format(amount);

  return `The driver drove ${formattedSpeed} and has to pay ${formattedAmount}`;
}

console.log(getFine(130, 300))
```

- A: The driver drove 130 and has to pay 300
- B: The driver drove 130 mph and has to pay \$300.00
- C: The driver drove undefined and has to pay undefined
- D: The driver drove 130.00 and has to pay 300.00

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `Intl.NumberFormat` method, we can format numeric values to any locale. We format the numeric value `130` to the `en-US` locale as a `unit` in `mile-per-hour`, which results in `130 mph`. The numeric value `300` to the `en-US` locale as a `currency` in `USD` results in `$300.00`.

### 127. What's the output?

```javascript
const spookyItems = ['👻', '🎃', '🕸'];
({ item: spookyItems[3] } = { item: '💀' });

console.log(spookyItems);
```

- A: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸"]`
- B: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]`
- C: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", { item: "💀" }]`
- D: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "[object Object]"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

By destructuring objects, we can unpack values from the right-hand object, and assign the unpacked value to the value of the same property name on the left-hand object. In this case, we're assigning the value "💀" to `spookyItems[3]`. This means that we're modifying the `spookyItems` array, we're adding the "💀" to it. When logging `spookyItems`, `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]` gets logged.

### 128. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia Hallie';
const age = 21;

console.log(Number.isNaN(name));
console.log(Number.isNaN(age));

console.log(isNaN(name));
console.log(isNaN(age));
```

- A: `true` `false` `true` `false`
- B: `true` `false` `false` `false`
- C: `false` `false` `true` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `false` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `Number.isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is a _numeric value_ and equal to `NaN`. `name` is not a numeric value, so `Number.isNaN(name)` returns `false`. `age` is a numeric value, but is not equal to `NaN`, so `Number.isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

With the `isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is not a number. `name` is not a number, so `isNaN(name)` returns true. `age` is a number, so `isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

### 129. What's the output?

```javascript
const randomValue = 21;

function getInfo() {
  console.log(typeof randomValue);
  const randomValue = 'Lydia Hallie';
}

getInfo();
```

- A: `"number"`
- B: `"string"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referenceable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.

### 130. What's the output?

```javascript
const myPromise = Promise.resolve('Woah some cool data');

    throw new Error(`Oops didn't work`);
  } finally {

```

- A: `Woah some cool data`
- B: `Oh finally!`
- C: `Woah some cool data` `Oh finally!`
- D: `Oops didn't work` `Oh finally!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

In the `try` block, we're logging the awaited value of the `myPromise` variable: `"Woah some cool data"`. Since no errors were thrown in the `try` block, the code in the `catch` block doesn't run. The code in the `finally` block _always_ runs, `"Oh finally!"` gets logged.

```javascript
const emojis = ['🥑', ['✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]];

console.log(emojis.flat(1));

- A: `['🥑', ['✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]]`
- B: `['🥑', '✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]`
- C: `['🥑', ['✨', '✨', '🍕', '🍕']]`
- D: `['🥑', '✨', '✨', '🍕', '🍕']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `flat` method, we can create a new, flattened array. The depth of the flattened array depends on the value that we pass. In this case, we passed the value `1` (which we didn't have to, that's the default value), meaning that only the arrays on the first depth will be concatenated. `['🥑']` and `['✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]` in this case. Concatenating these two arrays results in `['🥑', '✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]`.

```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `2`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KxLlTm9.png" width="400">

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.

- D: `Timeout 1! Promise 1! Last line 1! Promise 2! Timeout 2! Last line 2!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif">here</a>.)

Then we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. Pay attention, that now only the first then clause was added to the microtask queue.

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line 1!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. 

Since the callstack is not empty yet, the `setTimeout` function and promise in `funcOne` cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo`, the variable `res` gets `Promise` because `Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise'))` is equivalent to `Promise.resolve('Promise')` since resolving a promise just resolves it's value. The `await` in this line stops the execution of the function until it receives the resolution of the promise and then keeps on running synchronously until completion, so `Promise 2!` and then `Last line 2!` are logged and the `setTimeout` is sent to the Web API. If the first then clause in `funcOne` had its own log statement, it would be printed before `Promise 2!`. Howewer, it executed silently and put the second then clause in microtask queue. So, the second clause will be printed after `Promise 2!`.

Then the call stack is empty. Promises are _microtasks_ so they are resolved first when the call stack is empty so `Promise 1!` gets to be logged.

Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout 1!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout 2!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout 1!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout 2!`, and gets popped off the stack.

### 134. How can we invoke `sum` in `sum.js` from `index.js?`

```javascript
// sum.js
export default function sum(x) {
  return x + x;
}

// index.js
import * as sum from './sum';
```

- A: `sum(4)`
- B: `sum.sum(4)`
- C: `sum.default(4)`
- D: Default aren't imported with `*`, only named exports

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the asterisk `*`, we import all exported values from that file, both default and named. If we had the following file:

```javascript
// info.js
export const name = 'Lydia';
export const age = 21;
export default 'I love JavaScript';

// index.js
import * as info from './info';
console.log(info);
```

The following would get logged:

```javascript
{
  default: "I love JavaScript",
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21
}
```

For the `sum` example, it means that the imported value `sum` looks like this:

```javascript
{ default: function sum(x) { return x + x } }
```

We can invoke this function, by calling `sum.default`

#### Answer: C

With a Proxy object, we can add custom behavior to an object that we pass to it as the second argument. In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contains two properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, and `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.

The first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.

First, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.

Then, we access a property value on the proxy object, and the `get` property on the handler object is invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.

### 136. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Lydia Hallie' };

Object.seal(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `person.age = 21`
- C: `delete person.name`
- D: `Object.assign(person, { age: 21 })`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `Object.seal` we can prevent new properties from being _added_, or existing properties to be _removed_.

However, you can still modify the value of existing properties.

### 137. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia Hallie',
  address: {
    street: '100 Main St',
  },
};

Object.freeze(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `delete person.address`
- C: `person.address.street = "101 Main St"`
- D: `person.pet = { name: "Mara" }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.

### 138. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = x => x + x;

function myFunc(num = 2, value = add(num)) {
  console.log(num, value);
}

myFunc();
myFunc(3);
```

- A: `2` `4` and `3` `6`
- B: `2` `NaN` and `3` `NaN`
- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` is the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

### 139. What's the output?

```javascript
class Counter {
  #number = 10

  increment() {
    this.#number++
  }

  getNum() {
    return this.#number
  }
}

const counter = new Counter()
counter.increment()

console.log(counter.#number)
```

- A: `10`
- B: `11`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In ES2020, we can add private variables in classes by using the `#`. We cannot access these variables outside of the class. When we try to log `counter.#number`, a SyntaxError gets thrown: we cannot access it outside the `Counter` class!

### 140. What's missing?

```javascript
const teams = [
  { name: 'Team 1', members: ['Paul', 'Lisa'] },
  { name: 'Team 2', members: ['Laura', 'Tim'] },
];

function* getMembers(members) {
  for (let i = 0; i < members.length; i++) {
    yield members[i];
  }
}

function* getTeams(teams) {
  for (let i = 0; i < teams.length; i++) {
    // ✨ SOMETHING IS MISSING HERE ✨
  }
}

const obj = getTeams(teams);
obj.next(); // { value: "Paul", done: false }
obj.next(); // { value: "Lisa", done: false }
```

- A: `yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- B: `yield* getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- C: `return getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- D: `return yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.

### 141. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia Hallie',
  hobbies: ['coding'],
};

function addHobby(hobby, hobbies = person.hobbies) {
  hobbies.push(hobby);
  return hobbies;
}

addHobby('running', []);
addHobby('dancing');
addHobby('baking', person.hobbies);

console.log(person.hobbies);
```

- A: `["coding"]`
- B: `["coding", "dancing"]`
- C: `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`
- D: `["coding", "running", "dancing", "baking"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `addHobby` function receives two arguments, `hobby` and `hobbies` with the default value of the `hobbies` array on the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"running"` as the value for `hobby` and an empty array as the value for `hobbies`. Since we pass an empty array as the value for `hobbies`, `"running"` gets added to this empty array.

Then, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"dancing"` as the value for `hobby`. We didn't pass a value for `hobbies`, so it gets the default value, the `hobbies` property on the `person` object. We push the hobby `dancing` to the `person.hobbies` array.

Last, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"baking"` as the value for `hobby`, and the `person.hobbies` array as the value for `hobbies`. We push the hobby `baking` to the `person.hobbies` array.

After pushing `dancing` and `baking`, the value of `person.hobbies` is `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`

### 142. What's the output?

```javascript
class Bird {
  constructor() {
    console.log("I'm a bird. 🦢");
  }
}

class Flamingo extends Bird {
  constructor() {
    console.log("I'm pink. 🌸");
    super();
  }
}

const pet = new Flamingo();
```

- A: `I'm pink. 🌸`
- B: `I'm pink. 🌸` `I'm a bird. 🦢`
- C: `I'm a bird. 🦢` `I'm pink. 🌸`
- D: Nothing, we didn't call any method

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We create the variable `pet` which is an instance of the `Flamingo` class. When we instantiate this instance, the `constructor` on `Flamingo` gets called. First, `"I'm pink. 🌸"` gets logged, after which we call `super()`. `super()` calls the constructor of the parent class, `Bird`. The constructor in `Bird` gets called, and logs `"I'm a bird. 🦢"`.

### 143. Which of the options result(s) in an error?

```javascript
const emojis = ['🎄', '🎅🏼', '🎁', '⭐'];

/* 1 */ emojis.push('🦌');
/* 2 */ emojis.splice(0, 2);
/* 3 */ emojis = [...emojis, '🥂'];
/* 4 */ emojis.length = 0;
```

- A: 1
- B: 1 and 2
- C: 3 and 4
- D: 3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `const` keyword simply means we cannot _redeclare_ the value of that variable, it's _read-only_. However, the value itself isn't immutable. The properties on the `emojis` array can be modified, for example by pushing new values, splicing them, or setting the length of the array to 0.

### 144. What do we need to add to the `person` object to get `["Lydia Hallie", 21]` as the output of `[...person]`?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lydia Hallie",
  age: 21
}

[...person] // ["Lydia Hallie", 21]
```

- A: Nothing, object are iterable by default
- B: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield* this[x] }`
- C: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { yield* Object.values(this) }`
- D: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield this }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Objects aren't iterable by default. An iterable is an iterable if the iterator protocol is present. We can add this manually by adding the iterator symbol `[Symbol.iterator]`, which has to return a generator object, for example by making it a generator function `*[Symbol.iterator]() {}`. This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `["Lydia Hallie", 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`.

</p>

### 145. What's the output?

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach(num => {
	if (num) count += 1
})

console.log(count)
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `if` condition within the `forEach` loop checks whether the value of `num` is truthy or falsy. Since the first number in the `nums` array is `0`, a falsy value, the `if` statement's code block won't be executed. `count` only gets incremented for the other 3 numbers in the `nums` array, `1`, `2` and `3`. Since `count` gets incremented by `1` 3 times, the value of `count` is `3`.

### 146. What's the output?

```javascript
function getFruit(fruits) {
	console.log(fruits?.[1]?.[1])
}

getFruit([['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']])
getFruit()
getFruit([['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']])
```

- A: `null`, `undefined`, 🍌
- B: `[]`, `null`, 🍌
- C: `[]`, `[]`, 🍌
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`, 🍌

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `?` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects. We're trying to log the item on index `1` within the subarray that's on index `1` of the `fruits` array. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array doesn't exist, it'll simply return `undefined`. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array exists, but this subarray doesn't have an item on its `1` index, it'll also return `undefined`. 

First, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍍']` subarray of `[['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']]`. This subarray only contains one item, which means there is no item on index `1`, and returns `undefined`.

Then, we're invoking the `getFruits` function without passing a value as an argument, which means that `fruits` has a value of `undefined` by default. Since we're conditionally chaining the item on index `1` of`fruits`, it returns `undefined` since this item on index `1` does not exist. 

Lastly, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍊', '🍌']` subarray of `['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']`. The item on index `1` within this subarray is `🍌`, which gets logged.

### 147. What's the output?

```javascript
class Calc {
	constructor() {
		this.count = 0 
	}

	increase() {
		this.count++
	}
}

const calc = new Calc()
new Calc().increase()

console.log(calc.count)
```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `calc` equal to a new instance of the `Calc` class. Then, we instantiate a new instance of `Calc`, and invoke the `increase` method on this instance. Since the count property is within the constructor of the `Calc` class, the count property is not shared on the prototype of `Calc`. This means that the value of count has not been updated for the instance calc points to, count is still `0`.

### 148. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "e@mail.com",
	password: "12345"
}

const updateUser = ({ email, password }) => {
	if (email) {
		Object.assign(user, { email })
	}

	if (password) {
		user.password = password
	}

	return user
}

const updatedUser = updateUser({ email: "new@email.com" })

console.log(updatedUser === user)
```

- A: `false`
- B: `true`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `updateUser` function updates the values of the `email` and `password` properties on user, if their values are passed to the function, after which the function returns the `user` object. The returned value of the `updateUser` function is the `user` object, which means that the value of updatedUser is a reference to the same `user` object that `user` points to. `updatedUser === user` equals `true`.

### 149. What's the output?

```javascript
const fruit = ['🍌', '🍊', '🍎']

fruit.slice(0, 1)
fruit.splice(0, 1)
fruit.unshift('🍇')

console.log(fruit)
```

- A: `['🍌', '🍊', '🍎']`
- B: `['🍊', '🍎']`
- C: `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`
- D: `['🍇', '🍌', '🍊', '🍎']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke the `slice` method on the fruit array. The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji.
Then, we invoke the `splice` method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of `['🍊', '🍎']`.
At last, we invoke the `unshift` method on the `fruit` array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‘🍇’ in this case,  as the first element in the array.  The fruit array now consists of `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`.

### 150. What's the output?

```javascript
const animals = {};
let dog = { emoji: '🐶' }
let cat = { emoji: '🐈' }

animals[dog] = { ...dog, name: "Mara" }
animals[cat] = { ...cat, name: "Sara" }

console.log(animals[dog])
```

- A: `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara" }`
- B: `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are converted to strings. 

Since the value of  `dog` is an object,  `animals[dog]` actually means that we’re creating a new property called `"[object Object]"` equal to the new object. `animals["[object Object]"]` is now equal to `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara"}`.

`cat` is also an object, which means that `animals[cat]` actually means that we’re overwriting the value of  `animals["[object Object]"]` with the new cat properties. 

Logging `animals[dog]`, or actually `animals["[object Object]"]` since converting the `dog` object to a string results `"[object Object]"`, returns the `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`.

</p>

### 151. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "my@email.com",
	updateEmail: email => {
		this.email = email
	}
}

user.updateEmail("new@email.com")
console.log(user.email)
```

- A: `my@email.com`
- B: `new@email.com`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `updateEmail` function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the `user` object. This means that the `this` keyword is not referring to the `user` object, but refers to  the global scope in this case. The value of `email` within the `user` object does not get updated. When logging the value of `user.email`, the original value of `my@email.com` gets returned.

### 152. What's the output?

```javascript

const runPromises = async () => {
	const res1 = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
	const res2  = await Promise.all([promise3, promise4])
	return [res1, res2]
}

runPromises()
	.then(res => console.log(res))
	.catch(err => console.log(err))
```

- A: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Fourth']]`
- B: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Third', 'Fourth']]`
- C: `[['First', 'Second']]`
- D: `'Third'`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `Promise.all` method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the `Promise.all` method _rejects_ with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, `promise3` is rejected with the value `"Third"`. We’re catching the rejected value in the chained `catch` method on the `runPromises` invocation to catch any errors  within the `runPromises` function. Only `"Third"` gets logged, since `promise3` is rejected with this value.

### 153. What should the value of `method` be to log `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`? 

```javascript
const keys = ["name", "age"]
const values = ["Lydia", 22]

const method = /* ?? */
Object[method](keys.map((_, i) => {
	return [keys[i], values[i]]
})) // { name: "Lydia", age: 22 }
```

- A: `entries`
- B: `values`
- C: `fromEntries`
- D: `forEach`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `fromEntries` method turns a 2d array into an object. The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the `keys` array, which returns an array that the first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index. 

This creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`

	return {
		email,
		address: address ? address : null
	}
}

const member = createMember({ email: "my@email.com" })
console.log(member)
```

- A: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: null }`
- B: `{ email: "my@email.com" }`
- C: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: {} }`
- D: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: undefined }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The default value of `address` is an empty object `{}`. When we set the variable `member` equal to the object returned by the `createMember` function, we didn't pass a value for the address, which means that the value of the address is the default empty object `{}`. An empty object is a truthy value, which means that the condition of the `address ? address : null` conditional returns `true`. The value of the address is the empty object `{}`.

</p>

### 155. What's the output?

```javascript
let randomValue = { name: "Lydia" }
randomValue = 23

if (!typeof randomValue === "string") {
	console.log("It's not a string!")
} else {
	console.log("Yay it's a string!")
}
```

- A: `It's not a string!`
- B: `Yay it's a string!`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The condition within the `if` statement checks whether the value of `!typeof randomValue` is equal to `"string"`. The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`. In this case, the returned value of `typeof randomValue` is the truthy value `"number"`, meaning that the value of `!typeof randomValue` is the boolean value `false`.

`!typeof randomValue === "string"` always returns false, since we're actually checking `false === "string"`. Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it's a string!` gets logged.

Here is a collection of 60 tricky JavaScript coding questions, along with their answers:

### 1. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] + []);
```
**Answer:** `""` (empty string). When you add two empty arrays, JavaScript coerces them to strings, resulting in an empty string.

### 2. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] == []);
```
**Answer:** `false`. Arrays are reference types, so two different arrays are not equal even if they contain the same elements.

---

### 3. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log({} + []);
```
**Answer:** `"[object Object]"`. An object is converted to its string representation, which is "[object Object]". Adding it to an empty array results in that string.

---

### 4. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] + {});
```
**Answer:** `"[object Object]"`. The array `[]` is coerced to an empty string `""`, and then the empty object `{}` is coerced to "[object Object]".

---

### 5. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] + [1]);
```
**Answer:** `"1"`. The empty array `[]` is coerced into an empty string `""`, and then the array `[1]` becomes `"1"`, resulting in the string `"1"`.

---

### 6. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + "1");
```
**Answer:** `"11"`. JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string and concatenates it with the string `"1"`.

---

### 7. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(true + 1);
```
**Answer:** `2`. The boolean `true` is coerced to `1`, and then `1 + 1` equals `2`.

---

### 8. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("1" - 1);
```
**Answer:** `0`. JavaScript converts the string `"1"` to a number and then subtracts `1`.

---

### 9. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
```
**Answer:** `false`. This is a result of floating-point precision errors in JavaScript.

---

### 10. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("0" == false);
```
**Answer:** `true`. JavaScript coerces `"0"` to a number, and `false` is coerced to `0`, so they are equal.

---

### 11. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(null == undefined);
```
**Answer:** `true`. In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are loosely equal to each other.

---

### 12. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(null === undefined);
```
**Answer:** `false`. Strict equality (`===`) does not perform type coercion, so `null` and `undefined` are not strictly equal.

---

### 13. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("1" == [1]);
```
**Answer:** `true`. JavaScript coerces the array `[1]` into the string `"1"`, which is equal to `"1"`.

---

### 14. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] == true);
```
**Answer:** `false`. The array `[1]` is an object, and objects are not loosely equal to booleans.

---

### 15. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] == false);
```
**Answer:** `true`. The empty array `[]` is coerced to an empty string `""`, which is then coerced to `false`, making the equality `true`.

---

### 16. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] == [1]);
```
**Answer:** `false`. Arrays are reference types, and two different arrays with the same content are not equal.

---

### 17. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] === [1]);
```
**Answer:** `false`. Strict equality compares object references, and since both arrays are different objects, they are not strictly equal.

---

### 18. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(typeof NaN);
```
**Answer:** `"number"`. Even though `NaN` stands for "Not a Number," its type is still `number`.

---

### 19. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(typeof typeof 1);
```
**Answer:** `"string"`. The first `typeof 1` evaluates to `"number"`, and then `typeof "number"` evaluates to `"string"`.

---

### 20. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(parseInt("100px"));
```
**Answer:** `100`. `parseInt` parses the string until it encounters a non-numeric character, so it stops at the number `100`.

---

### 21. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(parseInt("abc"));
```
**Answer:** `NaN`. Since the string `"abc"` does not start with a number, `parseInt` returns `NaN`.

---

### 22. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(parseInt("10.5"));
```
**Answer:** `10`. `parseInt` only reads the integer part of a number, truncating the decimal portion.

---

### 23. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("10" - 1);
```
**Answer:** `9`. JavaScript coerces the string `"10"` to the number `10`, and then subtracts `1`.

---

### 24. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("10" * 2);
```
**Answer:** `20`. The string `"10"` is coerced to the number `10`, and then multiplied by `2`.

---

### 25. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + "1" - 1);
```
**Answer:** `"10"`. The `1 + "1"` results in the string `"11"`, and then `"11" - 1` coerces `"11"` to `11`, resulting in `10`.

---

### 26. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + "1" - "1");
```
**Answer:** `0`. The `1 + "1"` results in the string `"11"`, and `"11" - "1"` coerces `"11"` to a number and subtracts `1`, resulting in `10`.

---

### 27. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + 2 + "3");
```
**Answer:** `"33"`. The first addition `1 + 2` gives `3`, and then `3 + "3"` results in the string `"33"`.

---

### 28. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + +"1");
```
**Answer:** `2`. The unary plus (`+`) converts the string `"1"` to a number, and `1 + 1` results in `2`.

---

### 29. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("1" + + "1");
```
**Answer:** `"11"`. The second `"1"` is converted to a number with the unary `+`, and then the string `"1"` is concatenated with `1`, giving `"11"`.

---

### 30. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(!!"0");
```
**Answer:** `true`. Any non-empty string, including `"0"`, is coerced to `true`.

---

### 31. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(!!null);
```
**Answer:** `false`. `null` is falsy, so `!!null` coerces it to `false`.

---

### 32. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(!!undefined);
```
**Answer:** `false`. `undefined` is falsy, so `!!undefined` coerces it to `false`.

---

### 33. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(!!0);
```
**Answer:** `false`. `0` is falsy, so `!!0` coerces it to `false`.

---

### 34. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(!!1);
```
**Answer:** `true`. `1` is truthy, so `!!1` coerces it to `true`.

---

### 35. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] == true);
```
**Answer:** `false`. An array is not equal to a boolean, even though it contains a truthy value.

---

### 36. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] == "1");
```
**Answer:** `true`. JavaScript coerces the array `[1]` into the string `"1"`, so the comparison is true.

---

### 37. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1] == 1);
```
**Answer:** `true`. The array `[1]` is coerced into the string `"1"`, which is then coerced into the number `1`, so the comparison is true.

---

### 38. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([] == ![]);
```
**Answer:** `false`. The empty array `[]` is an object, and the negation of an empty array (`![]`) results in `false`, making the comparison false.

---

### 39. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(+true);
```
**Answer:** `1`. The unary `+` converts the boolean `true` to `1`.

---

### 40. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(+false);
```
**Answer:** `0`. The unary `+` converts the boolean `false` to `0`.

---

### 41. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(2 + "2" - 1);
```
**Answer:** `"21"`. The `2 + "2"` results in `"22"`, and `"22" - 1` coerces `"22"` to `22`, resulting in `21`.

---

### 42. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("1" + 1 + 1);
```
**Answer:** `"111"`. The first `1 + 1` results in the string `"1"`, and `"1" + 1` results in `"11"`, then `"11" + 1` results in `"111"`.

---

### 43. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(1 + 1 + "1");
```
**Answer:** `"21"`. The first `1 + 1` results in `2`, and then `2 + "1"` results in the string `"21"`.

---

### 44. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(true + true);
```
**Answer:** `2`. `true` is coerced to `1`, so `1 + 1` equals `2`.

---

### 45. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log(false + false);
```
**Answer:** `0`. `false` is coerced to `0`, so `0 + 0` equals `0`.

---

### 46. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("3" * "2");
```
**Answer:** `6`. The strings `"3"` and `"2"` are coerced into numbers, and then multiplied.

---

### 47. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("3" / "2");
```
**Answer:** `1.5`. The strings `"3"` and `"2"` are coerced into numbers, and then divided.

---

### 48. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("3" % "2");
```
**Answer:** `1`. The strings `"3"` and `"2"` are coerced into numbers, and the modulus operation returns the remainder of `3 % 2`.

---

### 49. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log("Hello" - "World");
```
**Answer:** `NaN`. Since subtraction is not defined for strings, the result is `NaN`.

---

### 50. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([].push(1));
```
**Answer:** `1`. The `push` method returns the new length of the array, which is `1` after pushing `1`.

---

### 51. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].pop());
```
**Answer:** `3`. The `pop` method removes and returns the last element of the array.

---

### 52. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].shift());
```
**Answer:** `1`. The `shift` method removes and returns the first element of the array.

---

### 53. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([].unshift(1));
```
**Answer:** `1`. The `unshift` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array, and returns the new length.

---

### 54. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].reverse());
```
**Answer:** `[3, 2, 1]`. The `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array.

---

### 55. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].join("-"));
```
**Answer:** `"1-2-3"`. The `join` method joins all elements of the array into a string, separated by the specified separator.

---

### 56. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5]));
```
**Answer:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The `concat` method merges arrays into one array.

---

### 57. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].slice(1, 2));
```
**Answer:** `[2]`. The `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

---

### 58. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].splice(1, 1));
```
**Answer:** `[2]`. The `splice` method removes elements from an array and returns them.

---

### 59. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].every(num => num > 0));
```
**Answer:** `true`. The `every` method checks if all elements satisfy the condition.

---

### 60. **What is the output of the following code?**
```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3].some(num => num > 2));
```
**Answer:** `true`. The `some` method checks if at least one element satisfies the condition.

## Question 1. What's the difference between `undefined` and `not defined` in JavaScript

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JavaScript if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error `var name is not defined` and the script will stop executing thereafter. But If you use `typeof undeclared_variable` then it will return `undefined`.

Before starting further discussion let's understand the difference between declaration and definition.

`var x` is a declaration because we are not defining what value it holds yet, but we are declaring its existence and the need for memory allocation.

```javascript
var x; // declaring x
console.log(x); // output: undefined
```

`var x = 1` is both declaration and definition, here declaration and assignment of value happen inline for variable x—what we are doing is called "initialisation". In JavaScript both variable declarations and function declarations go to the top of the scope in which they are declared, then assignment happens—this series of events is called "hoisting".

A variable can be declared but not defined. When we try to access it, It will result `undefined`.

```javascript
var x; // Declaration
typeof x === 'undefined'; // Will return true
```

A variable can be neither declared nor defined. When we try to reference such variable then the result will be `not defined`.

```javascript
console.log(y);  // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined
```

## Question 2. For which value of `x` the results of the following statements are not the same?


```javascript
if( x <= 100 ) {...}
if( !(x > 100) ) {...}
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

`NaN <= 100` is `false` and `NaN > 100` is also `false`, so if the
value of `x` is `NaN`, the statements are not the same.

The same holds true for any value of x that being converted to type Number, returns `NaN`, e.g.: `undefined`, `[1,2,5]`, `{a:22}` , etc.

This is why you need to pay attention when you deal with numeric variables. `NaN` can’t be equal, less than or more than any other numeric value, so the only reliable way to check if the value is `NaN`, is to use the `isNaN()` function.

</details>

## Question 3. What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

One of the drawbacks of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that they are very memory inefficient.  When you do that, a new copy of the method is created for each instance of an object. Here's an example:

```javascript
var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {
  this.name = name || "";       
  this.company = company || "";
  this.salary = salary || 5000;

  // We can create a method like this:
  this.formatSalary = function () {
      return "$ " + this.salary;
  };
};

// Alternatively we can add the method to Employee's prototype:
Employee.prototype.formatSalary2 = function() {
    return "$ " + this.salary;
}

//creating objects
var emp1 = new Employee('Yuri Garagin', 'Company 1', 1000000);
var emp2 = new Employee('Dinesh Gupta', 'Company 2', 1039999);
var emp3 = new Employee('Erich Fromm', 'Company 3', 1299483);
```

In this case each instance variable `emp1`, `emp2`, `emp3` has its own copy of the`formatSalary` method. However the `formatSalary2` will only be added once to `Employee.prototype`.

</details>

## Question 4. What is “closure” in javascript? Can you provide an example?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

A closure is a function defined inside another function (called parent function) and as such it has access to the variables declared and defined within its parent function's scope.

The closure has access to the variables in three scopes:

- Variable declared in its own scope
- Variable declared in its parent function's scope
- Variable declared in the global namespace

```javascript
var globalVar = "abc"; //Global variable

// Parent self-invoking function
(function outerFunction (outerArg) { // start of outerFunction's scope

  var outerFuncVar = 'x'; // Variable declared in outerFunction's function scope   
  
  // Closure self-invoking function
  (function innerFunction (innerArg) { // start of innerFunction's scope

    var innerFuncVar = "y"; // variable declared in innerFunction's function scope
    console.log(         
      "outerArg = " + outerArg + "\n" +
      "outerFuncVar = " + outerFuncVar + "\n" +
      "innerArg = " + innerArg + "\n" +
      "innerFuncVar = " + innerFuncVar + "\n" +
      "globalVar = " + globalVar);
  	
  // end of innerFunction's scope
  
  })(5); // Pass 5 as parameter to our Closure

// end of outerFunction's scope

})(7); // Pass 7 as parameter to the Parent function
```

`innerFunction` is a closure which is defined inside `outerFunction` and consequently has access to all the variables which have been declared and defined within `outerFunction`'s scope as well as any variables residing in the program's global scope.

The output of the code above would be:

```javascript
outerArg = 7
outerFuncVar = x
innerArg = 5
innerFuncVar = y
globalVar = abc
```

</details>

## Question 5. Write a mul function which will work properly when invoked with following syntax.

```javascript
console.log(mul(2)(3)(4)); // output : 24
console.log(mul(4)(3)(4)); // output : 48
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
function mul (x) {
  return function (y) { // anonymous function
    return function (z) { // anonymous function
      return x * y * z;
    };
  };
}
```

Here the `mul` function accepts the first argument and returns an anonymous function which then takes the second parameter and returns one last anonymous function which finally takes the third and final parameter; the last function then multiplies `x`, `y` and `z`, and returns the result of the operation.

In Javascript, a function defined inside another function has access to the outer function's scope and can consequently return, interact with or pass on to other functions, the variables belonging to the scopes that incapsulate it.

- A function is an instance of the Object type
- A function can have properties and has a link to its constructor method
- A function can be stored as a variable
- A function can be passed as a parameter to another function
- A function can be returned by another function

## Question 6. How to empty an array in JavaScript?
For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList =  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];
```

How can we empty the array above?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

There are a couple of ways by which we can empty an array, So let's discuss all the possible way by which we can empty an array.

#### Method 1

```javascript
arrayList = [];
```

The code above will set the variable `arrayList` to a new empty array. This is recommended if you don't have **references to the original array** `arrayList` anywhere else because It will actually create a new empty array. You should be careful with this way of empty the array, because if you have referenced this array from another variable, then the original reference array will remain unchanged, Only use this way if you have only referenced the array by its original variable `arrayList`.

For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList = []; // Empty the array
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

#### Method 2

```javascript
arrayList.length = 0;
```

The code above will clear the existing array by setting its length to 0. This way of emptying an array will also update all the reference variables that point to the original array. 

For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList.length = 0; // Empty the array by setting length to 0
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []
```

#### Method 3

```javascript
arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length);
```

Above implementation will also work perfectly. This way of empty the array will also update all the references of the original array.

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length); // Empty the array by setting length to 0
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []
```

#### Method 4

```javascript
while(arrayList.length) {
  arrayList.pop();
}
```

Above implementation can also empty the array. But not recommended to use often.


</details>

## Question 7. How to check if an object is an array or not?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The best way to find whether an object is instance of a particular class or not using `toString` method from `Object.prototype`

```javascript
var arrayList = [1 , 2, 3];
```

One of the best use cases of type checking of an object is when we do method overloading in JavaScript. To understand this, let's say we have a method called `greet` which can take a single string and also a list of strings. To make our `greet` method workable in both situation we need to know what kind of parameter is being passed: is it single value or list of values?

```javascript
function greet(param) {
  if() {
    // here have to check whether param is array or not
  }
  else {
  }
}
```

However, in the above implementation it might not necessary to check the type of the array, we can check for single value string and put array logic code in else block, let see below code for the same.

```javascript
 function greet(param) {
   if(typeof param === 'string') {
   }
   else {
     // If param is of type array then this block of code would execute
   }
 }
```

Now it's fine we can go with the previous two implementations, but when we have a situation like a parameter can be `single value`, `array`, and `object` type then we will be in trouble.

Coming back to checking the type of an object, As we mentioned that we can use `Object.prototype.toString`

```javascript
if(Object.prototype.toString.call(arrayList) === '[object Array]') {
  console.log('Array!');
}
```

If you are using `jQuery` then you can also used jQuery `isArray` method:

```javascript
if($.isArray(arrayList)) {
  console.log('Array');
} else {
  console.log('Not an array');
}
```

FYI jQuery uses `Object.prototype.toString.call` internally to check whether an object is an array or not.

In modern browser, you can also use:

```javascript
Array.isArray(arrayList);
```

`Array.isArray` is supported by Chrome 5, Firefox 4.0, IE 9, Opera 10.5 and Safari 5


</details>

## Question 8. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var output = (function(x) {
  delete x;
  return x;
})(0);

console.log(output);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will output `0` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is not an object, it's a **local variable**. `delete` operator doesn't affect local variables.


</details>

## Question 9. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var x = 1;
var output = (function() {
  delete x;
  return x;
})();

console.log(output);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will output `1` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is not an object it's **global variable** of type `number`.


</details>

## Question 10. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var x = { foo : 1};
var output = (function() {
  delete x.foo;
  return x.foo;
})();

console.log(output);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will output `undefined` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is an object which has foo as a property and from a self-invoking function, we are deleting the `foo` property of object `x` and after deletion, we are trying to reference deleted property `foo` which result `undefined`.


</details>

## Question 11. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var Employee = {
  company: 'xyz'
}
var emp1 = Object.create(Employee);
delete emp1.company
console.log(emp1.company);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The code above will output `xyz` as output. Here `emp1` object got company as **prototype** property. delete operator doesn't delete prototype property.

`emp1` object doesn't have **company** as its own property. you can test it `console.log(emp1.hasOwnProperty('company')); //output : false` However, we can delete company property directly from `Employee` object using `delete Employee.company` or we can also delete from `emp1` object using `__proto__` property `delete emp1.__proto__.company`.


</details>

## Question 12. What is `undefined x 1` in JavaScript

```javascript
var trees = ["redwood", "bay", "cedar", "oak", "maple"];
delete trees[3];
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
 - When you run the code above and do `console.log(trees);` in chrome developer console then you will get `["redwood", "bay", "cedar", undefined × 1, "maple"]`.
 - In the recent versions of Chrome you will see the word `empty` of `undefined x 1`.
 - When you run the same code in Firefox browser console then you will get `["redwood", "bay", "cedar", undefined, "maple"]`
  
Clearly we can see that Chrome has its own way of displaying uninitialized index in arrays. However when you check `trees[3] === undefined` in any browser you will get similar output as `true`.

**Note:** Please remember that you need not check for the uninitialized index of the array in  `trees[3] === 'undefined × 1'` it will give an error because `'undefined × 1'` this is just way of displaying an uninitialized index of an array in chrome.



</details>

## Question 13. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var trees = ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", "ryan", "apple"];
delete trees[3];
console.log(trees.length);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The code above will output `5` as output. When we used `delete` operator for deleting an array element then, the array length is not affected by this. This holds even if you deleted all elements of an array using `delete` operator.

So when delete operator removes an array element that deleted element is no longer present in the array. In place of value at deleted index `undefined x 1` in **chrome** and `undefined` is placed at the index. If you do `console.log(trees)` output `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined × 1, "apple"]` in Chrome and in Firefox `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined, "apple"]`.



</details>

## Question 14. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var bar = true;
console.log(bar + 0);   
console.log(bar + "xyz");  
console.log(bar + true);  
console.log(bar + false);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will output `1, "truexyz", 2, 1` as output. Here's a general guideline  for the plus operator:
  - Number + Number  -> Addition
  - Boolean + Number -> Addition
  - Boolean + Boolean -> Addition
  - Number + String  -> Concatenation
  - String + Boolean -> Concatenation
  - String + String  -> Concatenation
  
  

</details>

## Question 15. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var z = 1, y = z = typeof y;
console.log(y);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will print string `"undefined"` as output. According to associativity rule operator with the same precedence are processed based on their associativity property of operator. Here associativity of the assignment operator is `Right to Left` so first `typeof y` will evaluate first which is string `"undefined"` and assigned to `z` and then `y` would be assigned the value of z. The overall sequence will look like that: 

```javascript
var z;
z = 1;
var y;
z = typeof y;
y = z;
```

</details>

## Question 16. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
// NFE (Named Function Expression)
var foo = function bar() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `Reference Error`. To fix the bug we can try to rewrite the code a little bit: 

**Sample 1**

```javascript
var bar = function() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```

or

**Sample 2**

```javascript
function bar() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```

The function definition can have only one reference variable as a function name, In **sample 1** `bar` is reference variable which is pointing to `anonymous function` and in **sample 2** we have function statement and `bar` is the function name.

```javascript
var foo = function bar() {
  // foo is visible here
  // bar is visible here
  console.log(typeof bar()); // Works here :)
};
// foo is visible here
// bar is undefined here

## Question 17a. What is the difference between declaring a function in the formats listed below?

```javascript
var foo = function() {
  // Some code
}
```

```javascript
function bar () {
  // Some code
}
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The main difference is that function `foo` is defined at `run-time` and is called a function expression, whereas function `bar` is defined at `parse time` and is called a function statement. To understand it better, let's take a look at the code below :

```javascript
// Run-Time function declaration
  foo(); // Call foo function here, It will give an error
  var foo = function() {
    console.log("Hi I am inside Foo");
  };
```

```javascript
// Parse-Time function declaration
bar(); // Call bar function here, It will not give an Error
function bar() {
  console.log("Hi I am inside Foo");
}
```
</details>

## Question 17b. What is the output of the following?

```javascript
bar();
(function abc(){console.log('something')})();
function bar(){console.log('bar got called')};
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be :
``` 
bar got called
something
```
Since the function is called first and defined during parse time the JS engine will try to find any possible parse time definitions and start the execution loop which will mean function is called first even if the definition is post another function.

</details>

## Question 18. In which case the function definition is not hoisted in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Let's take the following **function expression**

```javascript
 var foo = function foo() {
     return 12;
 }
```

In JavaScript `var`-declared variables and functions are `hoisted`. Let's take function `hoisting` first. Basically, the JavaScript interpreter looks ahead to find all the variable declaration and hoists them to the top of the function where it's declared. For example:

```javascript
foo(); // Here foo is still undefined
var foo = function foo() {
  return 12;
};
```

The code above behind the scene look something like this:

```javascript
var foo = undefined;
foo(); // Here foo is undefined
foo = function foo() {
  // Some code stuff
}
```

```javascript
var foo = undefined;
foo = function foo() {
  // Some code stuff
}
foo(); // Now foo is defined here
```

</details>

## Question 19. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  var salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The code above will output: `undefined, 5000$` because of hoisting. In the code presented above, you might be expecting `salary` to retain it values from outer scope until the point that `salary` was re-declared in the inner scope. But due to `hoisting` salary value was `undefined` instead. To understand it better have a look of the following code, here `salary` variable is hoisted and declared at the top in function scope. When we print its value using `console.log` the result is `undefined`. Afterwards the variable is redeclared and the new value `"5000$"` is assigned to it.

```javascript
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  var salary = undefined;
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```

## Question 20. What’s the difference between `typeof` and `instanceof`?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

`typeof` is an operator that returns a string with the type of whatever you pass.

The `typeof` operator checks if a value belongs to one of the seven basic types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `function`, `undefined` or `Symbol`.

`typeof(null)` will return `object`.

`instanceof` is much more intelligent: it works on the level of prototypes. In particular, it tests to see if the right operand appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the left. `instanceof` doesn’t work with primitive types. The `instanceof` operator checks the current object and returns true if the object is of the specified type, for example:

```javascript
var dog = new Animal();
dog instanceof Animal; // Output : true
```

Here `dog instanceof Animal` is true since `dog` inherits from `Animal.prototype`

```javascript
var name = new String("xyz");
name instanceof String; // Output : true
```

## Question 21. Calculate the length of the associative array

```javascript
var counterArray = {
  A : 3,
  B : 4
};
counterArray["C"] = 1;
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

First of all, in the case of JavaScript an associative array is the same as an object. Secondly, even though there is no built-in function or property available to calculate the length/size an object, we can write such function ourselves.

#### Method 1

`Object` has `keys` method which can be used to calculate the length of object.

```javascript
Object.keys(counterArray).length; // Output 3
```

#### Method 2

We can also calculate the length of object by iterating through the object and by doing a count of own property of object. This way we will ignoge the properties that came from the object's prototype chain:  

```javascript
function getLength(object) {
  var count = 0;
  for(key in object) {
    // hasOwnProperty method check own property of object
    if(object.hasOwnProperty(key)) count++;
  }
  return count;
}
```

#### Method 3 

All modern browsers (including IE9+) support the [`getOwnPropertyNames`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames) method, so we can calculate the length using the following code: 

```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(counterArray).length; // Output 3
```

#### Method 4

[Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/#size) and [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#size) libraries have the method `size` dedicated to calculate the object length. We don't recommend to include one of these libraries just to use the `size` method, but if it's already used in your project - why not? 

```javascript
_.size({one: 1, two: 2, three: 3});
=> 3
```

## Question 22. Difference between `Function`, `Method` and `Constructor` calls in JavaScript.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

If your are familiar with Object-oriented programming, More likely familiar to thinking of functions, methods, and class constructors as three separate things. But In JavaScript, these are just three different usage patterns of one single construct.

functions : The simplest usages of function call:

```javascript
function helloWorld(name) {
  return "hello world, " + name;
}

helloWorld("JS Geeks"); // "hello world JS Geeks"
```

Methods in JavaScript are nothing more than object properties that are functions.

```javascript
var obj = {
  helloWorld : function() {
    return "hello world, " + this.name;
  },
  name: 'John Carter'
}
obj.helloWorld(); // // "hello world John Carter"
```

Notice how `helloWorld` refer to `this` properties of obj. Here it's clear or you might have already understood that `this` gets bound to `obj`. But the interesting point that we can copy a reference to the same function `helloWorld` in another object and get a difference answer. Let see:

```javascript
var obj2 = {
  helloWorld : obj.helloWorld,
  name: 'John Doe'
}
obj2.helloWorld(); // "hello world John Doe"
```

You might be wonder what exactly happens in a method call here. Here we call the expression itself determine the binding of this `this`, The expression `obj2.helloWorld()` looks up the `helloWorld` property of obj and calls it with receiver object `obj2`.

The third use of functions is as constructors. Like function and method, `constructors` are defined with function.

```javascript
function Employee(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

var emp1 = new Employee('John Doe', 28);
emp1.name; // "John Doe"
emp1.age; // 28
```

Unlike function calls and method calls, a constructor call `new Employee('John Doe', 28)` creates a brand new object and passes it as the value of `this`, and implicitly returns the new object as its result.

The primary role of the constructor function is to initialize the object.


</details>

## Question 23. What would be the output of the following code?

```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name || "JsGeeks";
}

var person = new User("xyz")["location"] = "USA";
console.log(person);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output of above code would be `"USA"`. Here `new User("xyz")` creates a brand new object and created property `location` on that and `USA` has been assigned to object property location and that has been referenced by the person.

Let say `new User("xyz")` created a object called `foo`. The value `"USA"` will be assigned to `foo["location"]`, but according to [ECMAScript Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-assignment-operators-runtime-semantics-evaluation) , pt 12.14.4 the assignment will itself return the rightmost value: in our case it's `"USA"`.
 Then it will be assigned to person. 
 
 To better understand what's going on here, try to execute this code in console, line by line:
 ```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name || "JsGeeks";
}

var person;
var foo = new User("xyz");
foo["location"] = "USA";
// the console will show you that the result of this is "USA"

```

## Question 24. What are Service Workers and when can you use them?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

It’s a technology that allows your web application to use cached resources first, and provide default experience offline, before getting more data from the network later. This principle is commonly known as Offline First.

Service Workers actively use promises. A Service Worker has to be installed,activated and then it can react on fetch, push and sync events.

As of 2017, Service Workers are not supported in IE and Safari.

</details>

## Question 25. What is the difference between a method and a function in javascript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

In JS, that difference is quite subtle. A function is a piece of code that is called by name and function itself not associated with any object and not defined inside any object. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. parameter) and can optionally return data (the return value).

```javascript
// Function statement
function myFunc() {
  // Do some stuff;
}

// Calling the function
myFunc();
```

Here myFunc() function call is not associated with object hence not invoked through any object.

A function can take a form of immediately invoked function expression (IIFE):

```javascript

// Anonymous Self-invoking Function
(function() {
  // Do some stuff;
})();
```

Finally there are also arrow functions: 

```javascript
const myFunc = arg => {
    console.log("hello", arg)
} 
```

A method is a piece of code that is called by its name and that is associated with the object. Methods are functions. When you call a method like this `obj1.myMethod()`, the reference to `obj1` gets assigned (bound) to `this` variable. In other words, the value of `this` will be `obj1` inside `myMethod`. 

Here are some examples of methods: 

##### Example 1
```javascript
var obj1 = {
  attribute: "xyz",
  myMethod: function () {  // Method
    console.log(this.attribute);
  }
};

// Call the method
obj1.myMethod();
```

Here `obj1` is an object and `myMethod` is a method which is associated with `obj1`.

##### Example 2
In ES6 we have classes. There the methods will look like this:

```javascript
class MyAwesomeClass {
  myMethod() {
    console.log("hi there");
  }
}

const obj1 = new MyAwesomeClass();
obj1.myMethod();
```

Understand: the method is not some kind of special type of a function, and it's not about how you declare a function. It's the way we **call** a function. Look at that: 

```javascript
var obj1 = {
  prop1: "buddy"
}; 
var myFunc = function () {
  console.log("Hi there", this);
};
// let's call myFunc as a function: 
myFunc(); // will output "Hi there undefined" or "Hi there Window"
 
obj1.myMethod = myFunc;
//now we're calling myFunc as a method of obj1, so this will point to obj1
obj1.myMethod(); // will print "Hi there" following with obj1. 

```

</details>

## Question 26. What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and how it can be useful?
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Definition
IIFE a function that runs as soon as it's defined. Usually it's anonymous (doesn't have a function name), but it also can be named. Here's an example of IIFE:

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE!");
})();
// outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE!"
```
#### Explanation

So, here's how it works. Remember the difference between function statements (`function a () {}`) and function expressions (`var a = function() {}`)? So, IIFE is a function expression. To make it an expression we surround our function declaration into the parens. We do it to explicitly tell the parser that it's an expression, not a statement (JS doesn't allow statements in parens).

After the function you can see the two `()` braces, this is how we run the function we just declared. 

That's it. The rest is details.  
- The function inside IIFE doesn't have to be anonymous. This one will work perfectly fine and will help to detect your function in a stacktrace during debugging: 
  ```javascript
  (function myIIFEFunc() {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE!");
  })();
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE!"
  ```
- It can take some parameters:
  ```javascript
  (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE, " + param1);
  })("Yuri");
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!"
  ```
  Here there value `"Yuri"` is passed to the `param1` of the function.
- It can return a value: 
  ```javascript
  var result = (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE, " + param1);
    return 1;
  })("Yuri");
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!"
  // result variable will contain 1
  ```
- You don't have to surround the function declaration into parens, although it's the most common way to define IIFE. Instead you can use any of the following forms: 
  - `~function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `!function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `+function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `-function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `(function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}());`
  - `var i = function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}();`
  - `true && function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }();`
  - `0, function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }();`
  - `new function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }`
  - `new function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }()`
  
  Please don't use all these forms to impress colleagues, but be prepared that you can encounter them in someone's code. 

#### Applications and usefulness

Variables and functions that you declare inside an IIFE are not visible to the outside world, so you can:
 - Use the IIFE for isolating parts of the code to hide details of implementation.
 - Specify the input interface of your code by passing commonly used global objects (window, document, jQuery, etc.) IIFE’s parameters, and then reference these global objects within the IIFE via a local scope.
 - Use it in closures, when you use closures in loops.
 - IIFE is the basis of in the module pattern in ES5
code, it helps to prevent polluting the global scope and provide the module interface to the outside.

## Question 27. Describe Singleton Pattern In JavaScript
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The singleton pattern is an often used JavaScript design pattern. It provides a way to wrap the code into a logical unit that can be accessed through a single variable. The Singleton design pattern is used when only one instance of an object is needed throughout the lifetime of an application. In JavaScript, Singleton pattern have many uses, they can be used for NameSpacing, which reduce the number of global variables in your page (prevent from polluting global space), organizing the code in a consistent manner, which increase the readability and maintainability of your pages.

There are two important points in the traditional definition of Singleton pattern:
- There should be only one instance allowed for a class and
- We should allow global point of access to that single instance

Let me define singleton pattern in JavaScript context:

> It is an object that is used to create namespace and group together a related set of methods and attributes (encapsulation) and if we allow to initiate then it can be initiated only once.

In JavaScript, we can create singleton though object literal. However, there is some another way but that I will cover in next post.

A singleton object consists of two parts: The object itself, containing the members (Both methods and attributes) within it, and global variable used to access it. The variable is global so that object can be accessed anywhere in the page, this is a key feature of the singleton pattern.

**JavaScript: A Singleton as a Namespace**

As I have already stated above that singleton can be used to declare Namespace in JavaScript. NameSpacing is a large part of responsible programming in JavaScript. Because everything can be overwritten, and it is very easy to wipe out variable by mistake or a function, or even a class without even knowing it. A common example which happens frequently when you are working with another team member parallel,  

```javascript
function findUserName(id) {

}

/* Later in the page another programmer
added code */
var findUserName = $('#user_list');

/* You are trying to call :( */
console.log(findUserName())
```

One of the best ways to prevent accidentally overwriting variable is to namespace your code within a singleton object.

```javascript
/*  Using Namespace */

var MyNameSpace = {
  findUserName : function(id) {},
  // Other methods and attribute go here as well
}

/* Later in the page another programmer
added code */
var findUserName = $('#user_list');

/* You are trying to call and you make this time workable */
console.log(MyNameSpace.findUserName());
```

### Singleton Design Pattern Implementation

```javascript
/* Lazy Instantiation skeleton for a singleton pattern */

var MyNameSpace = {};
MyNameSpace.Singleton = (function() {

  // Private attribute that holds the single instance
  var singletonInstance;  

  // All of the normal code goes here
  function constructor() {
    // Private members
    var privateVar1 = "Nishant";
    var privateVar2 = [1,2,3,4,5];

    function privateMethod1() {
      // code stuff
    }

    function privateMethod1() {
      // code stuff
    }

    return {
      attribute1 : "Nishant",
      publicMethod: function() {
        alert("Nishant");// some code logic
      }
    }
  }

  return {
    // public method (Global access point to Singleton object)
    getInstance: function() {
      //instance already exist then return  
      if(!singletonInstance) {
        singletonInstance = constructor();
      }
      return singletonInstance;           
    }           
  }

})();   

// getting access of publicMethod
console.log(MyNamespace.Singleton.getInstance().publicMethod());
```

The singleton implemented above is easy to understand. The singleton class maintains a static reference to the lone singleton instance and return that reference from the static getInstance() method.

## Question 28. What are the ways of creating objects in JavaScript ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Method 1: Function based

This method is useful if we want to create several similar objects. In the code sample below, we wrote the function `Employee` and used it as a constructor by calling it with the `new` operator. 

```javascript

  function Employee(fName, lName, age, salary){
  	this.firstName = fName;
  	this.lastName = lName;
  	this.age = age;
  	this.salary = salary;
  }

  // Creating multiple object which have similar property but diff value assigned to object property.
  var employee1 = new Employee('John', 'Moto', 24, '5000$');
  var employee2 = new Employee('Ryan', 'Jor', 26, '3000$');
  var employee3 = new Employee('Andre', 'Salt', 26, '4000$');
```

#### Method 2: Object Literal

Object Literal is best way to create an object and this is used frequently. Below is code sample for create employee object which contains property as well as method.

```javascript
var employee = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	salary : 245678,
	getName : function(){
		return this.name;
	}
}
```
The code sample below is Nested Object Literal, Here address is an object inside employee object.

```javascript
var employee = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	salary : 245678,
	address : {
		addressLine1 : 'BITS Pilani',
		addressLine2 : 'Vidya Vihar'.
		phoneNumber: {
		  workPhone: 7098889765,
		  homePhone: 1234567898
		}
	}
}
```
#### Method 3: From `Object` using `new` keyword

In the code below, a sample object has been created using `Object`'s constructor function.

```javascript
var employee = new Object(); // Created employee object using new keywords and Object()
employee.name = 'Nishant';
employee.getName = function(){
	return this.name;
}
```

#### Method 4:** Using `Object.create`

`Object.create(obj)` will create a new object and set the `obj` as its prototype. It’s a modern way to create objects that inherit properties from other objects. `Object.create` function doesn’t run the constructor. You can use `Object.create(null)` when you don’t want your object to inherit the properties of `Object`.

</details>

## Question 29. Write a function called deepClone which takes an object and creates a object copy of it.

``` javascript
var newObject = deepClone(obj);
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
function deepClone(object){
	var newObject = {};
	for(var key in object){
		if(typeof object[key] === 'object'  && object[key] !== null ){
		 newObject[key] = deepClone(object[key]);
		}else{
		 newObject[key] = object[key];
		}
	}
	return newObject;
}
```

**Explanation:** We have been asked to do deep copy of object so What's basically it's mean ??. Let's understand in this way you have been given an object `personalDetail` this object contains some property which again a type of object here as you can see `address` is an object and `phoneNumber` in side an `address` is also an object. In simple term `personalDetail` is nested object(object inside object). So Here deep copy means we have to copy all the property of `personalDetail` object including nested object.

```javascript
var personalDetail = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	address : {
	  location: 'xyz',
	  zip : '123456',
	  phoneNumber : {
	    homePhone: 8797912345,
	    workPhone : 1234509876
	  }
	}
}
```
So when we do deep clone then we should copy every property (including the nested object).

</details>

## Question 30. Best way to detect `undefined` object property in JavaScript.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

> Suppose we have given an object `person`

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'Nishant',
	age : 24
}
```
Here the `person` object has a `name` and `age` property. Now we are trying to access the **salary** property which we haven't declared on the person object so while accessing it will return undefined. So how we will ensure whether property is undefined or not before performing some operation over it?

**Explanation:**

We can use `typeof` operator to check undefined

```javascript
if(typeof someProperty === 'undefined'){
	console.log('something is undefined here');
}
```
Now we are trying to access salary property of person object.

```javascript
if(typeof person.salary === 'undefined'){
	console.log("salary is undefined here because we haven't declared");
}
```
</details>

## Question 31. Write a function called `Clone` which takes an object and creates a object copy of it but not copy deep property of object. 

```javascript
   var objectLit = {foo : 'Bar'}; 
	var cloneObj = Clone(obj); // Clone is the function which you have to write 
	console.log(cloneObj === Clone(objectLit)); // this should return false
	console.log(cloneObj == Clone(objectLit)); // this should return true
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
function Clone(object){
  var newObject = {};
  for(var key in object){
  	newObject[key] = object[key];
  }
  return newObject;
}
```

</details>

## Question 32. What are promises and how they are useful?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

We use promises for handling asynchronous interactions in a sequential manner. They are especially useful when we need to do an async operation and THEN do another async operation based on the results of the first one. For example, if you want to request the list of all flights and then for each flight you want to request some details about it. The promise represents the future value. It has an internal state (`pending`, `fulfilled` and `rejected`) and works like a state machine.

A promise object has `then` method, where you can specify what to do when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

You can chain `then()` blocks, thus avoiding the callback hell. You can handle errors in the `catch()` block.  After a promise is set to fulfilled or rejected state, it becomes immutable.

Also mention that you know about more sophisticated concepts: 
 - `async/await` which makes the code appear even more linear
 - RxJS observables can be viewed as the recyclable promises

Be sure that you can implement the promise, read [one of the articles on a topic](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2014/02/16/a-simple-promise-implementation-in-about-20-lines-of-javascript/), and learn the source code of the [simplest promise implementation](https://gist.github.com/softwaredoug/9044640). 


</details>

## Question 33. How to check whether a key exist in a JavaScript object or not.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Let say we have `person` object with property **name** and **age**

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'Nishant',
	age: 24
}
```
Now we want to check whether `name` property exist in `person` object or not ?

In JavaScript object can have own property, in above example name and age is own property of person object. Object also have some of inherited property of base object like toString is inherited property of person object.

So how we will check whether property is own property or inherited property. 

Method 1: We can use `in` operator on objet to check own property or inherited property. 

```javascript
console.log('name' in person); // checking own property print true 
console.log('salary' in person); // checking undefined property print false
```
`in` operator also look into inherited property if it doesn't find property defined as own property. For instance If I check existence of toString property as we know that we haven't declared this property on person object so `in` operator look into there base property.

Here 

```javascript
console.log('toString' in person); // Will print true
```
If we want to test property of object instance not inherited properties then we will use `hasOwnProperty` method of object instance.

```javascript
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // print false
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('name')); // print true
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('salary')); // print false
```

</details>

## Question 34. What is NaN, why do we need it, and when can it break the page?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

`NaN` stands for “not a number.” and it can break your table of numbers when it has an arithmetic operation that is not allowed. Here are some examples of how you can get `NaN`:

```javascript
Math.sqrt(-5);
Math.log(-1);
parseFloat("foo"); /* this is common: you get JSON from the server, convert some strings from JSON to a number and end up with NaN in your UI. */
```

`NaN` is not equal to any number, it’s not less or more than any number, also it's not equal to itself: 

```javascript
NaN !== NaN
NaN < 2 // false
NaN > 2 // false
NaN === 2 // false
```

To check if the current value of the variable is NaN, you have to use the `isNaN` function. This is why we can often see NaN in the webpages: it requires special check which a lot of developers forget to do.

## Question 35. Fix the bug using ES5 only

```javascript
var arr = [10, 32, 65, 2];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('The index of this number is: ' + i);
  }, 3000);
}
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

For ES6, you can just replace `var i` with `let i`. 

For ES5, you need to create a function scope like here:

```javascript 
var arr = [10, 32, 65, 2];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(j) {
    return function () {
      console.log('The index of this number is: ' + j)
    };
  }(i), 3000);
}
```

This can also achieve by forEach (allows you to keep that variable within the forEach’s scope)

```javascript 
var arr = [10, 32, 65, 2];
arr.forEach(function(ele, i) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('The index of this number is: ' + i);
  }, 3000);
})
```

</details>

## Question 36. How to check if the value of a variable in an array?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

We always encounter in such situation where we need to know whether value is type of array or not.

For instance : the code below perform some operation based value type

```javascript
function(value){
	if("value is an array"){
		// Then perform some operation
	}else{
		// otherwise
	}
}
```

Let's discuss some way to detect an array in JavaScript.

**Method 1:**

Juriy Zaytsev (Also known as kangax) proposed an elegant solution to this.

```javascript
	function isArray(value){
		return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Array]';
	}
```
This approach is most popular way to detecting a value of type array in JavaScript and recommended to use. This approach relies on the fact that, native toString() method on a given value produce a standard string in all browser. 


**Method 2:** 

Duck typing test for array type detection

```javascript
 // Duck typing arrays
 function isArray(value){
 	return typeof value.sort === 'function';
 }
```
As we can see above isArray method will return true if value object have `sort` method of type `function`. Now assume you have created a object with sort method

```javascript
	var bar = {
		sort: function(){
			// Some code 
		}
	}
```
Now when you check `isArray(bar)` then it will return true because bar object has sort method, But the fact is bar is not an array.

So this method is not a best way to detect an array as you can see it's not handle the case when some object has sort method.

**Method 3:** 

ECMAScript 5 has introduced **Array.isArray()** method to detect an array type value. The sole purpose of this method is accurately detecting whether a value is an array or not.

In many JavaScript libraries you may see the code below for detecting an value of type array.

```javascript
function(value){
   // ECMAScript 5 feature
	if(typeof Array.isArray === 'function'){
		return Array.isArray(value);
	}else{
	   return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Array]';
	}
}
```

**Method 4:**

You can query the constructor name:

```javascript
function isArray(value) {
	return value.constructor.name === "Array";
}

```

**Method 5:**

You check  if a given value is an `instanceof Array`:

```javascript
function isArray(value) {
	return value instanceof Array;
}
```

## Question 37. Best way to detect reference values of any type in JavaScript ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 In Javascript Object are called as reference type, Any value other then primitive is definitely a reference type. There are several built-in reference type such as **Object**, **Array**, **Function**, **Date**, **null** and **Error**.

Detecting object using `typeof` operator

```javascript
console.log(typeof {});           // object
console.log(typeof []);           // object
console.log(typeof new Array());  // object
console.log(typeof null);         // object 
console.log(typeof new RegExp()); // object
console.log(typeof new Date());   // object
```
But the downside of using typeof operator to detect an object is that typeof returns `object` for `null` (However this is fact that null is an object in JavaScript).

The best way to detect an object of specific reference type using `instanceof` operator.

>Syntax : **value** instanceof **constructor**   

```javascript
//Detecting an array
if(value instanceof Array){
	console.log("value is type of array");
}
```
```javascript
// Employee constructor function
function Employee(name){
	this.name = name; // Public property
}

var emp1 = new Employee('John');

console.log(emp1 instanceof Employee); // true
```
`instanceof` not only check the constructor which is used to create an object but also check it's prototype chain see below example.

```javascript
console.log(emp1 instanceof Object); // true
```

</details>

## Question 38. How does Object.create method works JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The ECMAScript 5 **Object.create()** method is the easiest way for one object to inherit from another, without invoking a constructor function. 

**For instance:** 

```javascript
var employee = {
  name: 'Nishant',
  displayName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

var emp1 = Object.create(employee);
console.log(emp1.displayName());  // output "Nishant"
```

In the example above, we create a new object `emp1` that inherits from `employee`. In other words `emp1`'s prototype is set to `employee`. After this emp1 is able to access the same properties and method on employee until new properties or method with the same name are defined.

**For instance:** Defining `displayName()` method on `emp1` will not automatically override the employee `displayName`.

```javascript
emp1.displayName = function() {
	console.log('xyz-Anonymous');
};

employee.displayName(); //Nishant
emp1.displayName();//xyz-Anonymous
``` 

In addition to this **`Object.create(`)** method also allows to specify a second argument which is an object containing additional properties and methods to add to the new object.

**For example**

```javascript
var emp1 = Object.create(employee, {
	name: {
		value: "John"
	}
});

emp1.displayName(); // "John"
employee.displayName(); // "Nishant"
```
In the example above, `emp1` is created with it's own value for name, so calling **displayName()** method will display `"John"` instead of `"Nishant"`.

Object created in this manner give you full control over newly created object. You are free to add, remove any properties and method you want.

</details>

## Question 39. How to use constructor functions for inheritance in JavaScript?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Let say we have `Person` class which has name, age, salary properties and **incrementSalary()** method.

```javascript
function Person(name, age, salary) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.salary = salary;
  this.incrementSalary = function (byValue) {
    this.salary = this.salary + byValue;
  };
}
```

Now we wish to create Employee class which contains all the properties of Person class and wanted to add some additional properties into Employee class.

```javascript
function Employee(company){
	this.company = company;
}

//Prototypal Inheritance 
Employee.prototype = new Person("Nishant", 24,5000);
```
In the example above, **Employee** type inherits from **Person**. It does so by assigning a new instance of `Person` to `Employee` prototype. After that, every instance of `Employee` inherits its properties and methods from `Person`.

```javascript
//Prototypal Inheritance 
Employee.prototype = new Person("Nishant", 24,5000);

var emp1 = new Employee("Google");

console.log(emp1 instanceof Person); // true
console.log(emp1 instanceof Employee); // true
```

Let's understand Constructor inheritance 

```javascript
//Defined Person class
function Person(name){
	this.name = name || "Nishant";
}

var obj = {};

// obj inherit Person class properties and method 
Person.call(obj); // constructor inheritance

console.log(obj); // Object {name: "Nishant"}
```
Here we saw calling **Person.call(obj)** define the name properties from `Person` to `obj`.

```javascript
console.log(name in obj); // true
```
Type-based inheritance is best used with developer defined constructor function rather than natively in JavaScript. In addition to this also allows flexibility in how we create similar type of object.

</details>

## Question 40. How we can prevent modification of object in JavaScript ?.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 ECMAScript 5 introduce several methods to prevent modification of object which lock down object to ensure that no one, accidentally or otherwise, change functionality of Object.

There are three levels of preventing modification: 

**1: Prevent extensions :** 

No new properties or methods can be added to the object, but one can change the existing properties and method.

For example: 

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

// lock the object 
Object.preventExtensions(employee);

// Now try to change the employee object property name
employee.name = "John"; // work fine 

//Now try to add some new property to the object
employee.age = 24; // fails silently unless it's inside the strict mode
```
**2: Seal :**

It is same as prevent extension, in addition to this also prevent existing properties and methods from being deleted.

To seal an object, we use **Object.seal()** method. you can check whether an object is sealed or not using **Object.isSealed();**

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee)); // true

delete employee.name // fails silently unless it's in strict mode

// Trying to add new property will give an error
employee.age = 30; // fails silently unless in strict mode
``` 

when an object is sealed, its existing properties and methods can't be removed. Sealed object are also non-extensible.

**3: Freeze :**

Same as seal, In addition to this prevent existing properties methods from being modified (All properties and methods are read only).

To freeze an object, use Object.freeze() method. We can also determine whether an object is frozen using Object.isFrozen();

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

//Freeze the object
Object.freeze(employee); 

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee));     // true
console.log(Object.isFrozen(employee));     // true


employee.name = "xyz"; // fails silently unless in strict mode
employee.age = 30;     // fails silently unless in strict mode
delete employee.name   // fails silently unless it's in strict mode
``` 

Frozen objects are considered both non-extensible and sealed.

**Recommended:**

If you are decided to prevent modification, sealed, freeze the object then use in strict mode so that you can catch the error.

For example: 

```javascript
"use strict";

var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

//Freeze the object
Object.freeze(employee); 

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee));     // true
console.log(Object.isFrozen(employee));     // true


employee.name = "xyz"; // fails silently unless in strict mode
employee.age = 30;     // fails silently unless in strict mode
delete employee.name;  // fails silently unless it's in strict mode
```

## Question 41. Write a log function which will add prefix `(your message)` to every message you log using console.log ? 
 For example, If you log `console.log("Some message")` then output should be **(your message) Some message**

 <details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Logging error message or some informative message is always required when you dealing with client side JavaScript using console.log method. Some time you want to add some prefix to identify message generated log from your application hence you would like to prefix your app name in every console.log. 

A general way to do this keep adding your app name in every console.log message like 

```javascript
console.log('your app name' + 'some error message');
```
But doing in this way you have to write your app name everytime when you log message using console.

There are some best way we can achieve this 

```javascript
function appLog() {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  args.unshift('your app name');
  console.log.apply(console, args);
}

appLog("Some error message"); 
//output of above console: 'your app name Some error message'
```

</details>

## Question 42 . Write a function which will test string as a literal and as an object ?

For example: We can create string using string literal and using String constructor function. 

```javascript
 // using string literal
 var ltrlStr = "Hi I am string literal";
 // using String constructor function 
 var objStr = new String("Hi I am string object");
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 We can use typeof operator to test string literal and instanceof operator to test String object.

```javascript
 function isString(str) {
 	return typeof(str) == 'string' || str instanceof String;
 }
 
 var ltrlStr = "Hi I am string literal";
 var objStr = new String("Hi I am string object");
 console.log(isString(ltrlStr)); // true
 console.log(isString(objStr)); // true
``` 
</details>

## Question 43 . What is typical use case for anonymous function in JavaScript ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 Anonymous functions basically used in following scenario.

1. No name is needed if function is only used in one place, then there is no need to add a name to function.

	Let's take the example of setTimeout function 
	
	```javascript
	setTimeout(function(){
		alert("Hello");
	},1000);
	```
	Here there is no need of using named function when we are sure 	that function which will alert `hello` would use only once in 	application.

2. Anonymous functions are declared inline and inline functions have advantages in the case that they can access variable in the parent scopes.

	Let's take a example of event handler. Notify event of particular 	type (such as click) for a given object. 
	
	Let say we have HTML element (button) on which we want to add click event and when user do click on button we would like to execute some logic.
	
	```html
	<button id="myBtn"></button>
	```
	Add Event Listener 
	
	```javascript
	var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
	btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
	  alert('button clicked');
	});
	```
	
	Above example shows used of anonymous function as a callback function in event handler.
	
3. Passing anonymous function as a parameter to calling function.
	
	Example: 
	
	```javascript
	// Function which will execute callback function
	function processCallback(callback){
		if(typeof callback === 'function'){
			callback();
		}
	}
	
	// Call function and pass anonymous function as callback 
	processCallback(function(){
		alert("Hi I am anonymous callback function");
	});
	```
The best way to make a decision for using anonymous function is to ask the following question:

 Will the function which I am going to define, be used anywhere else?

If your answer is yes then go and create named function rather anonymous function.

**Advantage of using anonymous function:**

1. It can reduce a bit of code, particularly in recursive function and in callback function.
2.  Avoid needless global namespace pollutions.

## Question 44 . How to set a default parameter value ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 If you are coming from python/c# you might be using default value for function parameter incase value(formal parameter) has not been passed. For instance : 

```python
// Define sentEmail function 
// configuration : Configuration object
// provider : Email Service provider, Default would be gmail
def sentEmail(configuration, provider = 'Gmail'):
	# Your code logic
```
**In Pre ES6/ES2015**

There are a lot of ways by which you can achieve this in pre ES2015.

Let's understand the code below by which we achieved setting default parameter value.

**Method 1: Setting default parameter value** 

```javascript
function sentEmail(configuration, provider) {
  // Set default value if user has not passed value for provider
  provider = typeof provider !== 'undefined' ? provider : 'Gmail'  
  // Your code logic
;
}
// In this call we are not passing provider parameter value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
});
// Here we are passing Yahoo Mail as a provider value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
}, 'Yahoo Mail');
```

**Method 2: Setting default parameter value** 

```javascript
function sentEmail(configuration, provider) {
  // Set default value if user has not passed value for provider
  provider = provider || 'Gmail'  
  // Your code logic
;
}
// In this call we are not passing provider parameter value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
});
// Here we are passing Yahoo Mail as a provider value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
}, 'Yahoo Mail');
```

**Method 3: Setting default parameter value in ES6**
```javascript
function sendEmail(configuration, provider = "Gmail") {
  // Set default value if user has not passed value for provider
  
  // Value of provider can be accessed directly
  console.log(`Provider: ${provider}`);
}

// In this call we are not passing provider parameter value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
});
// Here we are passing Yahoo Mail as a provider value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
}, 'Yahoo Mail');
```

## Question 45. Write code for merge two JavaScript Object dynamically.
Let say you have two objects 

```javascript
var person = {
	name : 'John',
	age  : 24
}

var address = {
	addressLine1 : 'Some Location x',
	addressLine2 : 'Some Location y',
	city : 'NewYork'
} 
```
Write merge function which will take two object and add all the own property of second object into first object.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```javascript
merge(person , address); 
 
/* Now person should have 5 properties 
name , age , addressLine1 , addressLine2 , city */
```
**Method 1: Using ES6, Object.assign method**

```javascript
const merge = (toObj, fromObj) => Object.assign(toObj, fromObj);
```
 
**Method 2: Without using built-in function**

```javascript
function merge(toObj, fromObj) {
  // Make sure both of the parameter is an object
  if (typeof toObj === 'object' && typeof fromObj === 'object') {
    for (var pro in fromObj) {
      // Assign only own properties not inherited properties
      if (fromObj.hasOwnProperty(pro)) {
        // Assign property and value
        toObj[pro] = fromObj[pro];
      }
    }
  }else{
  	throw "Merge function can apply only on object";
  }
}
```
</details>

## Question 46. What is non-enumerable property in JavaScript and how you can create one?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Object can have properties that don't show up when you iterate through object using for...in loop or using Object.keys() to get an array of property names. This properties is know as non-enumerable properties.

Let say we have following object

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'John'
};
person.salary = '10000$';
person['country'] = 'USA';

console.log(Object.keys(person)); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']
```
As we know that person object properties `name`, `salary` ,`country` are enumerable hence it's shown up when we called Object.keys(person).

To create a non-enumerable property we have to use **Object.defineProperty()**. This is a special method for creating non-enumerable property in JavaScript.

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'John'
};
person.salary = '10000$';
person['country'] = 'USA';

// Create non-enumerable property
Object.defineProperty(person, 'phoneNo',{
	value : '8888888888',
	enumerable: false
})

Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']
```
In the example above `phoneNo` property didn't show up because we made it non-enumerable by setting **enumerable:false**

**Bonus**

Now let's try to change value of `phoneNo`

```javascript
person.phoneNo = '7777777777'; 
```

**Object.defineProperty()** also lets you create read-only properties as we saw above, we are not able to modify phoneNo value of a person object. This is because descriptor has **writable** property, which is `false` by default. Changing non-writable property value will return error in strict mode. In non-strict mode it won't through any error but it won't change the value of phoneNo.

</details>

## Question 47. What is Function binding ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 Function binding falls in advance JavaScript category and this is very popular technique to use in conjunction with event handler and callback function to preserve code execution context while passing function as a parameter.

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
var clickHandler = {
	message: 'click event handler',
	handleClick: function(event) {
		console.log(this.message);
	}
};

var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
// Add click event to btn
btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler.handleClick);
```

Here in this example clickHandler object is created which contain message properties and handleClick method.

We have assigned handleClick method to a DOM button, which will be executed in response of click. When the button is clicked, then handleClick method is being called and console message. Here console.log should log the `click event handler` message but it actually log `undefined`.

The problem of displaying `undefined` is because of the execution context of clickHandler.handleClick method is not being saved hence `this` pointing to button `btn` object. We can fix this issue using bind method.

```javascript
var clickHandler = {
	message: 'click event handler',
	handleClick: function(event) {
		console.log(this.message);
	}
};

var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
// Add click event to btn and bind the clickHandler object
btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler.handleClick.bind(clickHandler));
```

`bind` method is available to all the function similar to call and apply method which take argument value of `this`.

### 48. How to replace callbackhell with Promise or Async/Await with examples ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- Part I Callbackhell.
- Calling one callback function inside another and so on is callbackhell.
- First we are defining three functions addTen, subFive and mulTwo. 
- These three functions while called with a number, will return a callback.
- The callback function will return either result or error.

```js
const addTen = (num, callback) =>
  {return callback(num+10, false)}
```

```js
const subFive = (num, callback) =>
  {return callback(num-5, false)}
```

```js
const mulTwo = (num, callback) =>
  {return callback(num*2, false)}
```

- Now lets call these one by one in nested way.
- The result of previous will serve as input for next callback.

```js
const ans = addTen(5, (addRes, addErr) => { // addRess = 15
        if(!addErr)
        {
            return subFive(addRes , (subRes, subErr) => { //subRes = 10
                if(!subErr){
                    return mulTwo(subRes, (mulRes, mulErr) => {
                        if(!mulErr)
                        {
                            return mulRes; //20
                        }
                    })
                }
            })
        }
    }) 
console.log(ans); // 20
```

- Part II Promise.
- Promise has two parameters resolve and reject. 
- Rewrting those three function definations as well, without a callback.

```js
const addTen = (num) => {return num+10}
```

```js
const subFive = (num) => {return num-5}
```

```js
const mulTwo = (num) => {return num*2}
```

- Creating a promise.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(true)
      resolve(5)
    else
      reject("Something went wrong ")
})
```

- Calling those three functions one by one.
- "then" will keep on returning the result and if any error "catch" will catch it.

```js
promise.then(addTen).then(subFive).then(mulTwo).then((ans)=>{
console.log(ans)
}).catch((err)=>{console.log(err)});
```

- Part III Async / Await.
- It actually uses promise internally.

```js
const addTen = ( num ) => {
    return new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {
        resolve( num+10)
    } )
}
```

```js
const subFive = ( num ) => {
    return new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {
        resolve( num-5)
    } )
}
```

```js
const mulTwo = ( num ) => {
    return new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {
        resolve( num*2)
    } )
}
```

- Put Async keyword before function name and Await before the statments inside the function
- Await will make the later code wait until the result of that statement is returned.
- Always put this inside a try/catch block.

```js
const ans = async (num) => {
    try {
        var addRes = await addTen(num);
        var subRes = await subFive(addRes);
        var mulRes = await mulTwo(subRes);
        console.log(mulRes)
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
}
ans(5)
```

# Coding Questions

## Passing values by reference vs by value
For a JS developer, it's crucially important to understand which values are passed by reference,
and which ones are passed by value. Remember that objects, including arrays are passed by reference
while strings, booleans and numbers are passed by value. 

### 1. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var strA = "hi there";
var strB = strA;
strB="bye there!";
console.log (strA)
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `'hi there'` because we're dealing with strings here. Strings are 
passed by value, that is, copied. 

</details>

###  2. What would be the output of following code?
```javascript
var objA = {prop1: 42};
var objB = objA; 
objB.prop1 = 90;
console.log(objA) 
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `{prop1: 90}` because we're dealing with objects here. Objects are 
passed by reference, that is, `objA` and `objB` point to the same object in memory. 

</details>

###  3. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var objA = {prop1: 42};
var objB = objA;
objB = {};
console.log(objA)
```


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `{prop1: 42}`. 

When we assign `objA` to `objB`, the `objB` variable will point
to the same object as the `objB` variable.

However, when we reassign `objB` to an empty object, we simply change where `objB` variable references to.
This doesn't affect where `objA` variable references to. 

</details>

###  4. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA;
arrB[0]=42;
console.log(arrA)
```


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `[42,1,2,3,4,5]`. 

Arrays are object in JavaScript and they are passed and assigned by reference. This is why
both `arrA` and `arrB` point to the same array `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. That's why changing the first
element of the `arrB` will also modify `arrA`: it's the same array in the memory.

</details>

###  5. What would be the output of following code?
```javascript
var arrA = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA.slice();
arrB[0]=42;
console.log(arrA)
```


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. 

The `slice` function copies all the elements of the array returning the new array. That's why
`arrA` and `arrB` reference two completely different arrays. 

</details>

###  6. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [{prop1: "value of array A!!"},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA;
arrB[0].prop1=42;
console.log(arrA);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `[{prop1: 42},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5]`. 

Arrays are object in JS, so both varaibles arrA and arrB point to the same array. Changing
`arrB[0]` is the same as changing `arrA[0]`

</details>

### 7. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [{prop1: "value of array A!!"}, {someProp: "also value of array A!"},3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA.slice();
arrB[0].prop1=42;
arrB[3] = 20;
console.log(arrA);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The output will be `[{prop1: 42},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5]`. 

The `slice` function copies all the elements of the array returning the new array. However,
it doesn't do deep copying. Instead it does shallow copying. You can imagine slice implemented like this: 
 
 ```javascript
function slice(arr) {
    var result = [];
    for (i = 0; i< arr.length; i++) {
        result.push(arr[i]);
    }
    return result; 
}
```

Look at the line with `result.push(arr[i])`. If `arr[i]` happens to be a number or string, 
it will be passed by value, in other words, copied. If `arr[i]` is an object, it will be passed by reference. 

In case of our array `arr[0]` is an object `{prop1: "value of array A!!"}`. Only the reference
to this object will be copied. This effectively means that arrays arrA and arrB share first
two elements. 

This is why changing the property of `arrB[0]` in `arrB` will also change the `arrA[0]`.

### 7. What would be the output of following code ?

```javascript
function getName1(){
	console.log(this.name);
}

Object.prototype.getName2 = () =>{
	console.log(this.name)
}

let personObj = {
	name:"Tony",
	print:getName1
}

personObj.print();
personObj.getName2();
```

1. undefined undefined
2. Tony undefined
3. undefined Tony
4. Tony Tony

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

 2) Tony undefined

Explaination: **getName1()** function works fine because it's being called from ***personObj***, so it has access to *this.name* property. But when while calling **getnName2** which is defined under *Object.prototype* doesn't have any proprty named *this.name*. There should be *name* property under prototype. Following is the code:

```javascript
function getName1(){
	console.log(this.name);
}

Object.prototype.getName2 = () =>{
  console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(this).name);
}

let personObj = {
	name:"Tony",
	print:getName1
}

personObj.print();
Object.prototype.name="Steve";
personObj.getName2();
```

### 8 . What would be the output of the following code ?
```javascript
let a = true;
let c = 0;

setTimeout(() => {
	a = false;
},2000)

while(a){
	console.log('Hello')
}
```
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary> 
The above program will print Hello infinitely. Since, Javascript is a single threaded language the actual execution happens only on the main thread. So, setTimeout will wailt for 2000 milliseconds on a seperate thread as while loop has occupied the main thread. The exit condition for the loop is to set the variable a as fasle. But as the loop continously running on the main thread , it a cannot be set false.

### 9 . What would be the output of the following code ?
```javascript

let c=0;

let id = setInterval(() => {
	console.log(c++)
},200)

setTimeout(() => {
	clearInterval(id)
},2000)
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The above program will print 0 to 9 sequentially.
