## Interview Tips

### Preparation Strategy
- Focus on core concepts first (OOP, Collections, Multithreading)
- Practice coding problems related to each topic
- Understand the "why" behind each concept, not just the "what"
- Be prepared to write code during the interview
- Practice explaining concepts clearly and concisely

### Common Interview Patterns
- Comparison questions (ArrayList vs LinkedList, HashMap vs TreeMap)
- Implementation questions (How does HashMap work internally?)
- Problem-solving questions (Implement a thread-safe singleton)
- Scenario-based questions (When would you use X over Y?)
- Code review questions (Find issues in given code)

### Key Areas to Master
1. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Foundation of Java
2. **Collections Framework** - Most frequently asked topic
3. **Multithreading** - Critical for senior positions
4. **Exception Handling** - Important for robust applications
5. **Memory Management** - Shows deep understanding of JVM
6. **Modern Java Features** - Demonstrates current knowledge

Remember: Quality over quantity. It's better to deeply understand fewer concepts than to have superficial knowledge of many topics.
